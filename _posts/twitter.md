Twitter provides us with vast amounts of user-generated language data — a dream for anyone wanting to conduct textual analysis. More than that, tweets allow us to gain insights into the online public behaviour. As such, analysing Twitter has become a crucial source of information for brands and agencies.
Several factors have given Twitter considerable advantages over other social media platforms for analysis. First, the limited character size of tweets provides us with a relatively homogeneous corpora. Second, the millions of tweets published everyday allows access to large data samples. Third, the tweets are publicly available and easily accessible as well as retrievable via APIs.
Nonetheless, extracting these insights still requires a bit of coding and programming knowledge. This is why, most often, brands and agencies rely on easy-to-use analytics tools such as SproutSocial and Talkwalker who provide these insights at a cost in just one click.
In this article, I help you to break down these barriers and provide you with a simple guide on how to extract and analyse tweets with the programming software R.

STEP 1: Getting your Twitter API access
In order to get started, you first need to get a Twitter API. This will allow you to retrieve the tweets — without it, you cannot do anything. Getting a Twitter API is easy. First make sure you have a Twitter account, otherwise create one. Then, apply for a developer account via the following website: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html. You’ll need to fill in an application form, which includes explaining a little a bit more what you wish you analyse.
Once you application has been accepted by Twitter (which doesn’t take too long), you’ll receive the following credentials that you need to keep safe:
Consumer key
Consumer Secret
Access Token
Access Secret
