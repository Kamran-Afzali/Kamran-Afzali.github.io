Learning health systems (LHS) are healthcare systems in which knowledge generation processes are embedded in daily practice to produce continual improvement in care.

Learning Health Systems are systems in which “science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery process and new knowledge captured as an integral by‐product of the delivery experience” (Institute of Medicine, 2015).

Learning Health Systems require vision, leadership and infrastructure to flourish. BC AHSN is working to develop key system components, including access to robust, comprehensive data and analytics; standardized approaches to timely measurement; supports for system and practice change; and stakeholder involvement.
