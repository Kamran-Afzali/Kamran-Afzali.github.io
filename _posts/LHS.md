While details surrounding the concept’s operationalisation remain debated, the movement towards value-based healthcare is among important yet challenging shifts currently taking place in the healthcare landscape aiming towards achieving the best possible care at the lowest cost. The concept is appealing because it represents a clear strategic focus to guide cooperative efforts to improve healthcare system performance and to potentially align the interests of all stakeholders. The main challenge in search of better value in health is the necessity of significant changes to the way health systems currently deliver and fund care, share data, support innovation, and evaluate performance.

As a first step in the process of development of value-based healthcare system a series of expert meetings by the office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies. These meeting were organized to explore strategies for accelerating the development of the digital infrastructure for the learning health system.

Health care as a complex adaptive system can benefit from data-based guidance related to issues such as the patient perspectives, locus of decisions, transparency, evidence, and waste reduction. All this effort aims towards ensuring that every healthcare decision is guided by comprehensive, accurate, and timely health data to improve the delivery of the right care to the right person for the right price.

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) mandated the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies to organize a series of expert meetings to explore strategies for accelerating the development of the digital infrastructure for the learning health system.

In other words, improvement health and economic performance is linked to the success in information technology, computational science, and bio- medical and health research methods. These factors enable real-time generation and application of new knowledge as well as seamless and efficient delivery of best care practices in the context of the of emergence of a learning health system. The pace and progress of the digital transformation will be determined by the alignment of culture, science, and technology, to foster the development of a continuously learning health system. 


## THE LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM


In 2001, the IOM report Crossing the Quality Chasm called national attention to untenable deficiencies in health care, noting that every patient should expect care that is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable (IOM, 2001). Based on the determination that health care is a complex adaptive system—one in which progress on its central purpose is shaped by tenets that are few, simple, and basic—the report identified several rules to guide health care. In particular, these rules underscore the importance of issues related to the locus of decisions, patient perspectives, evidence, transparency, and waste reduction. The report envisioned, in ef- fect, engaging patients, providers, and policy makers alike to ensure that every healthcare decision is guided by timely, accurate, and comprehensive health information provided in real time to ensure constantly improving delivery of the right care to the right person for the right price.

Along these lines, Learning health systems (LHS) are healthcare systems in which continual improvement in care is guided by data-based knowledge generation processes are embedded in daily practice.

Learning Health Systems are systems in which “science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery process and new knowledge captured as an integral by‐product of the delivery experience” (Institute of Medicine, 2015).

Learning Health Systems require vision, leadership and infrastructure to flourish. BC AHSN is working to develop key system components, including access to robust, comprehensive data and analytics; standardized approaches to timely measurement; supports for system and practice change; and stakeholder involvement.

LHSs were defined as systems where “science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery process and new knowledge captured as an integral by-product of the delivery experience”. Such systems would capitalise on major technological advances in order to foster more dynamic approaches to evidence generation and application, enable rapid learning and improvement based on data flowing from routine patient care, and ensure greater quality, safety and innovation in healthcare. 

Core values that should underpin LHSs have been identified previously and include accessibility, adaptability, cooperative and participatory leadership, governance, inclusiveness, person focused, privacy, scientific integrity, transparency, and value in healthcare.


Such systems can be based on any of the cyclical improvement approaches, such as Plan, Do, Study, Act, but they explicitly use technical and social approaches to learn and improve with every patient who is treated. In this review, we focus on behaviour change techniques as an effective mechanism to ensure that knowledge generated by Learning Healthcare Systems is fed back into the system to achieve change (the red side of the cycle).

There is no single Learning Healthcare System. Rather there are many manifestations, at different scales. It could be a department that tracks its patient�s outcomes in order to learn and improve its practice. It could be a provider that builds predictive models, from elements of its EHR, which allow it to forecast demand and reallocate resources more effectively. It could be a national distributed network drawing tens of millions of patient records from multiple providers, to assess the effectiveness of particular treatment. 

## THE DIGITAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE

The digital infrastructure for the learning health system will not solely be the result of features designed and built de novo; there is a growing body of existing initiatives and resources actively in play at multiple levels. These include expanding adoption of technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs), personal health records (PHRs), telehealth, health informa- tion portals, electronic monitoring devices, mobile health applications, and advances in molecular diagnostics. Also in play are collections of health information, such as biobanks, and health information databases main- tained by large health systems, private insurers, and regulatory agencies. Each adds important capacity for clinical care, clinical and health services research, public health surveillance and intervention, patient education and self-management, and safety and cost monitoring.

The striking progress in the capacity and influence of information technology on society over the past three decades is a blended product of interrelated initiatives arising from within the commercial, independent, and public sectors. Leaps in the speed and power of information processing, the efficiency of the operations, the development of the Internet and World Wide Web, and its use to facilitate near-universally available real-time access to information have spawned a new economy and new vehicles for progress.

Health information vendors, large and small, have emerged to meet the growing demand for capacity to manage the retrieval, storage, and delivery of information for agencies, institutions, professionals, and individuals in virtually every aspect of health and health care. The range of newly digitalized services—and the growth of vendors to provide them—is startling. Through technologies developed by companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, the rapidly expanding amounts of health-related information available on the Internet have become increasingly easy to access and query. The amount of web-based health information accessed daily by individuals and clinicians, and the frequency with which they turn to the Internet for this information, is already transforming the care process.

The technological pillar is similarly central to LHSs and includes a wide range of health technologies, devices, and IT infrastructure and systems. The array of technologies relevant to the LHS has been explored by the NAM but is constantly expanding and evolving. A distinctive feature of LHSs is their capacity to promote learning as a by-product of everyday care, which is only made possible through infrastructure that enables high-quality clinical data to be collected, aggregated, analysed and acted on. Some LHSs have been built around clinical registers housing uniformly collected data used to describe populations with specific diseases or characteristics and monitor their outcomes such as the registers used by ImprovingCareNow or the Swedish Rheumatology Society. In other LHSs, health data is gathered from electronic health record (EHR) systems, patients’ personal health records and/or research databases. Data from millions of patients can be stored in centralised data warehouses where it can then be aggregated, linked with other forms of data, and then leveraged for system learning and improvement. Other platforms for integrating data based on federated or mediated approaches have also been established. Hardware and software supporting the use of algorithms, machine learning, data mining and advances in artificial intelligence also offer unmistakable potential to identify new problems, examine trends in care, test solutions, and ultimately accelerate learning and innovation.
