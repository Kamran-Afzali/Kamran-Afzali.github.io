This report is an overview of academic programs in health informatics, covering a range of educational opportunities across different five different countries (Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, and United States) and academic levels (Bachelor, Masters, PhD, Fellowships). Here we go through twelve universities worldwide, offering specialized degrees tailored to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals in health information management and digital healthcare. At the undergraduate level, we investigated three training programs providing fundamental courses in areas in health informatics preparing graduates for the emerging opportunities and roles in the field. Our review highights the effort to organise undergraduate studies in health informatics as a multi-disciplinary collaboration between different faculties and departements. Moreover, institutions like the University of Chicago Illinois are equipping students with foundational knowledge in health information management through programs accredited by professional organizations like CAHIIM.  Moving to the master's and doctoral levels, universities offering courses and training degrees in health informatics, for students seeking specialized expertise and research opportunities. All twelve unversities offer masters programs with specialites ranging from eHealth, Digital Health and Data Science, and Clinical Informatics Management, to Cybersecurity et eHealth empowering students to become leaders and innovators in the healthcare industry. Similar to the undergraduate studies, several universities put in the effort to organise a multi-disciplinary collaborative cursus between different faculties, departements and even other universites (collaboration bettween McGill and Universite de Bordeaux). Moreover, seveal American institutions like the University of Chicago, Denver, and Buffalo present programs accredited by professional organizations like CAHIIM, AIMA, and HIMSS. At doctoral level, we investigated seven training programs mostly in continuation of the masters program to prepare the trainees further for research in health informatics, biomedical informatics or public health data science and to gain degrees such as a PhD, Dphill or Doctor of Pharmacy. Moreover, our overview extends beyond traditional health informatics academic pathways to include specialized programs for healthcare professionals seeking to increase their clinical expertise with informatics skills. Medical residencies and fellowships in health informatics, offered by three institutions, with unversities like Harvard University and the University of Buffalo, provide medical doctors with hands-on training and research opportunities in health inforamtics to improve healthcare delivery. Likewise, University of Victoria has a unique multidsciplinary program with a	double Master degree of nursing and health informatics. 

The presented training programs offer a diverse range of courses, broadly categorized into several key themes. Foundational knowledge courses on Health Informatics and Systems Design introduce students to essential concepts in managing healthcare data. Research-focused courses emphasize evidence-based practices and generating research in the field. Technological competencies are developed through courses focusing on programming for healthcare and Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, addressing the need for advanced technical skills. Professional development and ethical considerations are highlighted in courses that emphasize ethical decision-making and cultivating a strong professional identity. Clinical competency is integrated throughout the curriculum, especially in courses focused on healthcare delivery and patient safety. Lastly, managerial and leadership skills are emphasized recognizing their importance in implementing health informatics solutions within complex healthcare settings. This holistic approach combines foundational knowledge, research skills, technological competencies, ethical considerations, and leadership training to prepare students for diverse roles in the healthcare industry.
