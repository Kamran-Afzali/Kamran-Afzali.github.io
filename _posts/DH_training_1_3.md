This document presents an overview of academic programs in health informatics, covering a range of educational opportunities across different five different countries (Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, and United States) and academic levels (Bachelor, Masters, PhD, Fellowships). Here we go through twelve universities worldwide, offering specialized degrees tailored to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals in health information management and digital healthcare. At the undergraduate level, we have investigated three training programs providing fundamental courses in areas such as database design, healthcare delivery systems, and information security, preparing graduates for entry-level roles in the field. There is an emerging effort to organise undergraduate studies in health informatics as a multi-disciplinary collaborative efferot between different faculties and departements. Moreover, institutions like the University of Chicago Illinois are equipping students with foundational knowledge in health information management through programs accredited by professional organizations like CAHIIM.  Moving to the master's and doctoral levels, universities offering courses and training degrees in health informatics, for students seeking specialized expertise and research opportunities. These programs specialize into areas like  clinical informatics, data security, and health data science, empowering students to become leaders and innovators in the healthcare industry. Moreover, our overview extends beyond traditional health informatics academic pathways to include specialized programs for healthcare professionals seeking to increase their clinical expertise with informatics skills. Medical residencies and fellowships in health informatics, offered by institutions like Harvard University and the University of Buffalo, provide clinicians with hands-on training and research opportunities to leverage technology for improving patient care and healthcare delivery. 

Health informatics/Bio informatics/ Digital health programs presented in this document offer a diverse array of courses that can be broadly categorized into several main themes. Here we present a high level descriptions of the most recurring themes. The first theme revolves around **foundational knowledge**, introducing students to essential concepts in health informatics. This includes courses like "Health Informatics: An Overview" and "Health Information Systems Design." These courses aim to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the technological infrastructure supporting healthcare data management. The second theme encompasses research skills and **evidence-based practices**, as demonstrated by courses such as "Research Methods in Health Informatics" and "Disciplinary Research". These courses emphasize the importance of generating and utilizing evidence to inform decision-making in health informatics, ensuring that professionals can contribute meaningfully to advancements in the field. The third theme involves **technological competencies**, reflecting the evolving landscape of health informatics. Courses like "Programming for Healthcare" and "Artificial Intelligence in Health Care" highlight the need for professionals to possess advanced technical skills, including programming, database management, and an understanding of artificial intelligence, to address complex challenges in healthcare. The fourth theme centers around professional development and **ethical considerations**. Courses like "Professional Identity" and "Ethics for Health System Transformation" emphasize the importance of cultivating a strong professional identity and ethical decision-making within the broader healthcare context. It is noteworthy that **clinical competency and understanding** are a crucial component in health informatics programs, bridging the gap between healthcare practice and information technology. Various aspects of clinical competencies are embedded within the curriculum, especially in courses focused on healthcare delivery, patient safety, and the application of informatics in clinical settings. Finally , there is a **managerial and leadership component**, evident in courses such as "Organizational Behavior and Change Management" and "Project Management." These courses recognize the significance of effective leadership and management skills in implementing health informatics solutions within complex healthcare environments. Overall, the synthesis of these courses reveals a holistic approach in health informatics programs, combining foundational knowledge, research skills, technological competencies, ethical considerations, and leadership training. This comprehensive curriculum ensures that graduates are well-equipped to address the multifaceted challenges and opportunities within the dynamic field of health informatics.
