This report is an overview of academic programs in health informatics, covering a range of educational opportunities across different five different countries (Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, and United States) and academic levels (Bachelor, Masters, PhD, Fellowships). Here we go through twelve universities worldwide, offering specialized degrees tailored to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals in health information management and digital healthcare. At the undergraduate level, we investigated three training programs providing fundamental courses in areas in health informatics preparing graduates for the emerging opportunities and roles in the field. Our review highights the effort to organise undergraduate studies in health informatics as a multi-disciplinary collaboration between different faculties and departements. Moreover, institutions like the University of Chicago Illinois are equipping students with foundational knowledge in health information management through programs accredited by professional organizations like CAHIIM.  Moving to the master's and doctoral levels, universities offering courses and training degrees in health informatics, for students seeking specialized expertise and research opportunities. All twelve unversities offer masters programs with specialites ranging from eHealth, Digital Health and Data Science, and Clinical Informatics Management, to Cybersecurity et eHealth empowering students to become leaders and innovators in the healthcare industry. Similar to the undergraduate studies, several universities put in the effort to organise a multi-disciplinary collaborative cursus between different faculties, departements and even other universites (collaboration bettween McGill and Universite de Bordeaux). Moreover, seveal American institutions like the University of Chicago, Denver, and Buffalo present programs accredited by professional organizations like CAHIIM, AIMA, and HIMSS. At doctoral level, we investigated seven training programs mostly in continuation of the masters program to prepare the trainees further for research in health informatics, biomedical informatics or public health data science and to gain degrees such as a PhD, Dphill or Doctor of Pharmacy. Moreover, our overview extends beyond traditional health informatics academic pathways to include specialized programs for healthcare professionals seeking to increase their clinical expertise with informatics skills. Medical residencies and fellowships in health informatics, offered by three institutions, with unversities like Harvard University and the University of Buffalo, provide medical doctors with hands-on training and research opportunities in health inforamtics to improve healthcare delivery. Likewise, University of Victoria has a unique multidsciplinary program with a	double Master degree of nursing and health informatics. 

The presented training programs offer a diverse range of courses, broadly categorized into several key themes. Foundational knowledge courses on Health Informatics and Systems Design introduce students to essential concepts in managing healthcare data. Research-focused courses emphasize evidence-based practices and generating research in the field. Technological competencies are developed through courses focusing on programming for healthcare and Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, addressing the need for advanced technical skills. Professional development and ethical considerations are highlighted in courses that emphasize ethical decision-making and cultivating a strong professional identity. Clinical competency is integrated throughout the curriculum, especially in courses focused on healthcare delivery and patient safety. Lastly, managerial and leadership skills are emphasized recognizing their importance in implementing health informatics solutions within complex healthcare settings. This holistic approach combines foundational knowledge, research skills, technological competencies, ethical considerations, and leadership training to prepare students for diverse roles in the healthcare industry.

####  Medical schools 

- There is a need to educate family medicine residents in the realm of health informatics, applied data analytics for continuous quality improvement, and general principles of digital health technologies. However, the integration of health informatics concepts into the curricula of Canadian medical schools and residencies is proceeding slowly (see [here](https://www.cfp.ca/content/65/10/683)). There are offeres by medical associations to improve digital health training in medical schools, for instance [OMD](https://www.ontariomd.ca/documents/resource%20library/dig.%20health%20education%20for%20med%20school.pdf) proposes a Digital Health Curriculum that medical schools can leverage to deliver further value to your students. This digital health educational package includes well-defined instructional digital health materials developed by practicing physicians and digital health experts who are university faculty members. Each module in the curriculum is specifically designed to enhance experiential learning and can be easily customized to the learning goals of each university’s medical school and the student’s education year.  

## Selected Universities

The University of Victoria and McMaster University both offer comprehensive health informatics training programs, each with its own unique focus and approach. At the University of Victoria, the health informatics program is deeply integrated within the Nursing, Faculty of Human and Social Development, and Health Information Science departments. Students have the opportunity to pursue various degrees, including a Graduate Certificate, Bachelor's degree, and Master's degree, with the possibility of continuing to a PhD in health informatics. Additionally, the University of Victoria offers a unique Double Degree Master of Nursing program, combining expertise in both nursing and health informatics. On the other hand, McMaster University collaborates across three faculties—the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering, and the DeGroote School of Business—to offer a multidisciplinary approach to health informatics education. McMaster provides programs leading to a Graduate Diploma and a Master's degree, allowing students to acquire specialized knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. These programs reflect the universities' commitment to preparing graduates for impactful careers in health informatics, leveraging interdisciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge research opportunities.

This program requires a completion of a total of 31.5 units of study, including a research project or thesis. All course requirements must be completed prior to proceeding to the final oral examination. Students will have a supervisor from each School. Students with an overall A-average may complete a thesis, with the approval of both supervisors, the Director of the School of Health Information Science and the Associate Director, Graduate Education in the School of Nursing. Completion of a Master's degree with thesis is encouraged for students intending to pursue Doctoral studies. Students are expected to be enrolled full time for the duration of their program. Cooperative learning experiences must usually be undertaken outside of a student's current employment setting.
