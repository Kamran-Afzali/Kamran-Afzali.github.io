The digital revolution is transforming the landscape of health research and healthcare delivery. The rise of digital health technologies has led to the generation of vast amounts of qualitative and quantitative "big data," including digital traces of our everyday behaviors. This data holds valuable information that could potentially benefit patients and caregivers. However, the rapid integration of digital health technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) into research and clinical practice raises significant ethical concerns that need to be addressed.

One major concern is the protection of privacy and confidentiality of patient data. While consumers often agree to terms and conditions without fully understanding the implications, their data is being used to train algorithms and inform product improvements. This raises questions about informed consent, risk assessment, and whether the intended beneficiaries are truly being served.

The governance of digital health research is currently a "wild west," with various stakeholders involved, including technology developers, funders, researchers, participants, and journal editors. There is a lack of regulatory controls or common standards to guide this convergence in the health ecosystem. It is crucial to evaluate whether these technologies are clinically effective, measure what they claim to measure, and improve access to those at highest risk of health disparities.

To address these challenges, a digital health decision-making domains framework has been developed, comprising five domains: Participant Privacy, Risks and Benefits, Access and Usability, Data Management, and Ethical Principles. This framework aims to help stakeholders make sound decisions when selecting and implementing digital health technologies.

However, several gaps and opportunities exist in the digital health research landscape. Firstly, there are disciplinary and sector challenges, as technology makers may not understand patients' needs, computational scientists may train AI on unrepresentative datasets, and clinicians may struggle to manage granular data and AI-driven decisions. Secondly, there is a need to improve digital and technology literacy among various stakeholders, including policymakers, educators, regulators, clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Research is needed to understand their knowledge levels and develop targeted educational resources. Thirdly, there is a lack of consistent ethical and regulatory standards for evaluating and testing new digital health technologies and AI systems. Regulatory bodies and technologists may lack the necessary expertise or training to conduct appropriate risk assessments and ensure ethical practices.

To address these gaps, several initiatives have emerged, such as the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative, the Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research (PERVADE) program, and the Mobile Health ELSI (mHealthELSI) project. These initiatives aim to inform policy and governance in this largely unregulated space.

In conclusion, the digital health revolution holds transformational promise for improving healthcare, but it also introduces new ethical challenges. It is crucial to develop the necessary infrastructure for vetting new technologies, considering ethical principles, risks and benefits, privacy, access and usability, and data management. Interdisciplinary collaboration, improved technology literacy, and consistent ethical and regulatory standards are essential to ensure that these innovations benefit society without exacerbating health disparities or eroding public trust.


The digital health revolution is rapidly transforming research and clinical practice, but these technologies are being integrated without appropriate vetting or governance. There is a concerning lack of transparency and accountability around how consumer data is being collected, used, and monetized by companies. 

The common refrain "if the product is free, then you're the product" refers to how our online activities like searches, clicks, and keystrokes generate data that companies use to train algorithms and improve their products and services. Consumers unknowingly allow this data harvesting by mindlessly accepting dense terms and conditions that are designed to be confusing.

While some personalized recommendations or targeted ads enabled by this data may seem convenient, there are serious privacy implications. Algorithms can make mistakes or misinterpret our data in ways that invade our privacy or even put us at risk of harm. For example, Facebook's AI has mistakenly interpreted innocuous posts as indicating self-harm, leading to unwarranted wellness checks or police visits. 

Yet companies like Facebook claim their data practices and algorithms do not constitute "research" despite the lack of informed consent, risk assessment, or ensuring the intended beneficiaries are truly benefiting. Beyond privacy threats, we must question whether there is a rigorous evaluation of potential harms versus benefits for the individuals whose data is being exploited.

The digital health ecosystem is a "wild west" with various stakeholders – developers, funders, researchers, participants, journals – but no unified governance or ethical standards. As these technologies proliferate in research and healthcare, it is crucial to evaluate their clinical effectiveness, validity, reliability, and equitable access. Will they truly improve outcomes and reduce health disparities?

However, many stakeholders lack the expertise to properly vet these technologies. Not all undergo rigorous scientific testing before deployment, putting the public at risk of using unproven or flawed products. Demonstrating real-world value through research should be a prerequisite before any digital health technology claiming clinical benefits can be used.

While regulations are slowly emerging, all stakeholders must recognize their ethical obligation to uphold the integrity of digital health research in this unregulated space. A decision-making framework has been proposed with five intersecting domains: participant privacy, risk/benefit assessment, access and usability, data management, and ethical principles. This can guide stakeholders in evaluating and selecting appropriate digital health tools.

Without consistent standards and accountability measures, the digital health revolution risks undermining public trust and exacerbating harm, particularly for already disadvantaged populations. Collective action is needed to develop robust ethical practices that prioritize privacy, informed consent, rigorous evaluation, and equitable access as these technologies rapidly evolve.


The digital health revolution is rapidly advancing, with technologies like mobile apps, wearable sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) being integrated into research and clinical care. However, this ecosystem presents new ethical challenges that must be addressed. A major issue is the lack of governance and standards to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in healthcare settings. 

There are disciplinary and sector gaps, where different stakeholders may lack the necessary expertise to develop useful and ethical digital health tools. Technology makers may not fully understand patient needs, computational scientists could train AI on unrepresentative data, and clinicians may struggle to interpret granular data outputs. Bridging these gaps through interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial.

Another gap is the need for improved digital and technology literacy across various stakeholders - policymakers, educators, regulators, clinicians, patients, and the general public. Many may not have sufficient understanding of how these technologies work or their potential impacts. Targeted educational resources are needed to increase stakeholder knowledge and facilitate informed decision-making.

Perhaps the most significant gap is the lack of consistent ethical and regulatory standards for evaluating new digital health technologies, especially those involving AI. Institutional review boards may lack the expertise to properly assess the risks and potential harms. Tech developers may not receive training on ethics, privacy, and regulatory requirements for protecting human research participants. The data used to train AI algorithms is often not considered human subjects research, bypassing safety reviews.

To address these gaps, several initiatives have emerged to examine the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of digital health and AI technologies. Groups like the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative, Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research (PERVADE), and Mobile Health ELSI (mHealthELSI) project aim to inform policy and governance in this largely unregulated space. However, many of these efforts are broad in scope and may lack specificity for digital health applications.

As new health technologies proliferate, with an increasing number of stakeholders involved, the gap between known and unknown risks poses a fundamental challenge in evaluating the potential harms versus benefits. There is an urgent need to develop a robust infrastructure for vetting these technologies before widespread deployment in healthcare systems.

Implementing digital health tools requires careful consideration of ethical principles, risk/benefit assessments, privacy protection, equitable access and usability, and sound data management practices. While these innovations hold great potential value, a lack of rigorous vetting could exacerbate health disparities among vulnerable populations. Collective action is needed to establish ethical standards and accountability measures to ensure the responsible development and use of digital health technologies.


__________________________________________________________________
The ethics of digital health research encompass several key themes: ethical commitments in care, study design, digital health research peculiarities, and data governance. Within these themes, issues of inclusion, equity, participant safety, conflict of interest, study robustness, and data handling are critically examined to ensure ethical standards are maintained.

**Ethical Commitments in Care**

The Research Ethics Committees (RECs) emphasize the importance of inclusivity and equity in digital health studies. They inquire about the availability of necessary digital tools like smartphones and internet access, ensuring these are provided where needed. Concerns are raised about the potential withdrawal of these services post-study, which could impede continued care and participation. Compensation must be fair and consistent across all participants. The RECs also scrutinize software compatibility with various operating systems and physical adaptability of devices to different body shapes and features. They advocate for inclusive questionnaire options, especially regarding gender and Body Mass Index (BMI) criteria, ensuring a diverse participant pool. Non-English speakers and special patient populations require appropriate translation services and justifications for their inclusion or exclusion in studies. RECs encourage applicants to be as inclusive as possible and support them constructively through these complex ethical discussions.

**Participant Safety and Support**

A significant portion of discussions revolves around public and patient involvement (PPI) in study design and the development of comprehensible materials. Many applicants engage the public, but those who do not receive recommendations to do so. This involvement helps mitigate concerns about participant burden and frustration with the technology. Amendments to recruitment protocols are often requested to reduce participant pressure and ensure voluntary participation. Safety measures for control groups and sensitive populations are critically examined, with well-considered arrangements required. Clear and user-friendly instructions for technology usage are essential, and studies involving high-risk devices must undergo safety checks before approval.

**Conflict of Interest**

Conflicts of interest, though affecting a minority of applications, are meticulously addressed. Applicants must disclose all affiliations with sponsors and ensure that financially affiliated researchers do not consent patients. RECs place emphasis on clarifying relationships between researchers, organizations, and study locations, especially when submitted to Higher Education Institution (HEI) RECs.

**Study Design**

Issues in study design often stem from inconsistent recruitment methods and gaps in participant information. For example, recruiting from accident and emergency departments for studies requiring healthy volunteers necessitates clear medical exclusion criteria. RECs demand detailed justifications for participant inclusion and exclusion, ensuring that all necessary consent forms and information sheets are provided. The qualifications of clinicians involved in patient assessment and recruitment are scrutinized, and researchers must provide robust justifications for their sampling and recruitment methods.

**Protocol Robustness**

The adequacy of study protocols frequently requires intricate discussions, particularly concerning the necessity for medical testing, potential participant burdens, data collection rationale, and interview design. Some issues lead to the removal of entire protocol sections, underscoring the need for comprehensive reasoning and clarity.

**Harm Prevention**

Harm prevention is critical, with most applications encountering barriers related to unforeseen events such as participant non-adherence or emergencies. Mechanisms must be in place to detect and address these issues swiftly, with constant contact maintained for high-risk patients. Clear reaction protocols for unexpected events, such as device failures, are essential. Proper training for staff and clinicians, sterilization of materials, and listing device contraindications are emphasized to avert potential risks.

**Digital Health Research Peculiarities**

The necessity and value of research goals are scrutinized, particularly in the context of digital health interventions. RECs ensure that research objectives align with traditional healthcare outcomes and have practical implications. Remote encounters, although infrequent in causing action points, present unique challenges such as maintaining accuracy and privacy during assessments.

**Data Governance**

Data management, including storage, access, and transfer, is a significant focus. Applicants must de-identify data, clarify device ownership, and justify unconventional storage methods. Clear procedures for handling data upon participant withdrawal are required, along with secure data transfer protocols, especially in international collaborations. Anonymization and confidentiality strategies must be detailed, distinguishing between pseudonymous and anonymous data. Video and audio recording justifications are necessary, particularly regarding the duration of storage and sharing with sponsors.

In summary, digital health research must navigate a complex landscape of ethical challenges, requiring careful consideration of inclusivity, participant safety, conflict of interest, study design robustness, and data governance. Ensuring ethical standards in these areas fosters trust and integrity in digital health studies.

Digital technology in healthcare presents numerous benefits such as improved monitoring, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health-related issues. However, it also introduces a variety of ethical challenges, which are complex and multidimensional, affecting different stages of digital technology usage and involving various stakeholder groups and technologies. These challenges include privacy, confidentiality, data protection, equity in access to health services, accountability, patient empowerment, and the quality of health information.

Electronic Health Records (EHR) are a significant area of concern, with issues related to privacy, confidentiality, security breaches, system implementation, informed consent, data validity, inaccuracies, and patient commitment to health education systems. Mobile health (mHealth), which involves the use of smartphones in healthcare, faces ethical challenges such as the dissemination of poor information, disruption of patient-physician communication, unclear reports, electronic personal information security, reliability, undistinguished responsibility, and unexpected errors.

Telemedicine, which provides remote clinical services like diagnosis and monitoring, offers benefits such as cost reduction, time savings, and specialized support in remote areas. However, it also raises ethical concerns, including privacy issues and the determination of specialist responsibilities, as multiple specialists have access to patient information, increasing the risk of data misuse and privacy violations.

eHealth, which utilizes the internet and web technologies for healthcare services, faces ethical challenges from a legal perspective. These challenges include moral laws, international ethical mechanisms, and a lack of ethical education standards in professional training. The use of health-related internet information affects the patient-healthcare professional relationship, raising ethical issues such as the shift in participation, roles, responsibilities, and the need for accurate information.

Wearable digital technologies, such as wearable cameras, are used to investigate health behaviors and produce visual data. Ethical concerns in this area include informed consent, privacy, confidentiality, equality, and information safety. Big data also significantly impacts healthcare, raising ethical concerns that necessitate moral education and the equipping of epidemiologists with ethical tools.

A systematic literature review identified four main domains of ethical challenges in digital healthcare: ethical, social, legal, and governmental/regulatory. These challenges were further classified into six key indicators: justice, autonomy, privacy, security, responsibility, and procedural values. Procedural values, including transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness, are identified as key indicators of ethical challenges. Responsibility involves trust, power balance, stakeholder relationships, and benefit-sharing, and is essential for the development and implementation of digital healthcare systems.

Autonomy, a relatively new concept in digital healthcare, is crucial for protecting patient independence and dignity. Challenges related to autonomy include freedom of choice in treatment, informed consent, awareness of data collection and usage, and the right to know medical results. Privacy, one of the most critical ethical challenges, involves data protection, confidentiality, data sharing, and intended or unintended data uses.

Justice is defined by equal access to digital technology and healthcare, equity in treatment, non-discrimination, data ownership, and empowerment. Security, another significant factor, involves protecting patients' private information from unauthorized access, ensuring data storage safety, and safeguarding information during data transfers.

Overall, addressing these ethical challenges requires a comprehensive approach, including patient education, transparent procedures, accountability, and equitable access to digital healthcare technologies. Further research and continuous ethical evaluations are necessary to adapt to the evolving landscape of digital healthcare.
___________________________________________

The review reveals a generally positive attitude towards Precision
Medicine (PM) among both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients,
though professionals exhibit more skepticism regarding its actual
benefits. This skepticism is attributed to the limited evidence
supporting PM compared to conventional medicine, due in part to the
smaller scale of PM clinical trials. HCPs, trained in evidence-based
medicine, often feel underprepared to interpret genomic data and select
appropriate therapies. While machine learning can aid in data
interpretation, reliance on technology without proper verification is
cautioned against, highlighting the need for enhanced training in
medical informatics. Interdisciplinary collaboration, involving
bioinformaticians and genetic counselors, is deemed essential for
effective PM implementation.

Patient education on PM is crucial for informed decision-making,
necessitating personalized approaches that account for varying levels of
health and genetic literacy. Ethnic minorities and individuals with
disabilities, who often exhibit greater distrust or face additional
barriers, require special consideration. Traditional text-based
education methods are insufficient; innovative formats like short,
accessible video sequences are suggested, especially given the
widespread use of smartphones. However, personal consultations with
professionals must complement these educational tools.

Access to PM remains a significant ethical concern, with many
professionals doubting equitable access for all patients who could
benefit. The ethical principle of justice demands that PM be available
regardless of insurance status, ethnicity, age, or location. However,
national and international disparities in healthcare funding pose
challenges to this ideal. Recruitment biases, predominantly involving
Northern European genetic data, further exacerbate inequities, leaving
other population groups with uncertain benefits from PM. Additionally,
socio-economic factors, such as travel distance to medical centers and
digital competence, can hinder access.

The cost-benefit ratio of PM is another contentious issue. Some
professionals argue that other health interventions might offer greater
benefits and deserve better funding. Critics suggest reallocating
resources towards improving living conditions and health-related
behaviors, which could potentially yield more significant health
benefits. Despite these concerns, some studies indicate that PM is at
least as cost-effective as conventional care, warranting further
investigation into its economic viability.

Data security and privacy are paramount, given the risks of genetic
information misuse by insurance companies and employers, leading to
potential genetic discrimination. Integrating genetic data into
electronic health records increases vulnerability to cyber-attacks and
human error. Limiting data collection to essential information and
ensuring patients are aware of potential data breaches are recommended.
Patients' preferences regarding genetic information disclosure must be
respected to avoid undue stress or missed opportunities for preventive
care. Informed consent processes should clearly address the implications
of incidental findings and ensure patients understand their options.

PM also raises concerns about changes in the doctor-patient
relationship. The focus on genetic data might overshadow the patient's
personal history and values, risking a reductionist view of patients as
mere genetic entities. The potential alienation due to increased
digitalization and reliance on omics-based data calls for empirical
research to understand its impact on patient care.

Despite these challenges, both patients and professionals show a high
willingness to participate in PM research, though some patients desire
compensation for their contributions, particularly if their data or
biospecimens result in significant profits for pharmaceutical companies.
The concept of reciprocity in data donation is explored, emphasizing the
need to respect patients' wishes regarding their genetic information.

Lastly, the continuous monitoring and optimization encouraged by PM,
facilitated by smartphone apps and wearables, can place additional
psychological pressure on patients. This phenomenon, described as
"patient work" or "bio-citizenship," underscores the need for further
research into the psychological effects of sustained self-monitoring and
health optimization.

___________________________________________


This systematic review investigates patients' perspectives on the
ethical issues and risks associated with precision medicine, analyzing
24 articles from an initial pool of 914. The review highlights key
patient concerns and extends understanding of how precision medicine is
perceived in terms of ethics and potential risks.

The most prevalent concern among patients is privacy, confidentiality,
and data security. Patients across various ethnic groups express worries
about the misuse of personal data, which could lead to commercial
exploitation or impact insurance eligibility and employment
opportunities. Substance abuse patients, in particular, fear their data
might be used to resolve unsolved crimes, discouraging participation in
precision medicine research. Younger individuals focus more on data
accessibility than privacy breaches, while some patients support wider
genomic data sharing, although this may be influenced by participation
bias.

Economic implications are another significant concern, including the
costs of medical treatments and the impact on insurance. Patients worry
about the affordability of precision medicine tests and the potential
loss of insurance coverage due to genetic conditions. The Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in the US addresses some of
these concerns, but issues around insurance eligibility and employment
persist.

Psychosocial harms and the necessity for genetic counseling are also
prominent themes. Patients experience psychological distress from
frequent diagnostic scans and receiving genetic test results indicating
increased disease risks. This distress can affect their quality of life
and adherence to treatments. Specific concerns include unexpected
paternity revelations and fears of human cloning. Moreover, there is a
worry that knowing one's genetic predispositions might lead to
neglecting personal health responsibilities, emphasizing the need for
patient education.

Equitable access to precision medicine is another critical issue.
Patients fear racial discrimination and the misuse of their genetic
information against them. Historical instances, such as the Tuskegee
Syphilis Study, contribute to mistrust among certain ethnic groups.

Informed consent processes raise additional concerns. Patients are wary
of sharing their genetic information without clear communication and
understanding of future uses. The need for simple language in consent
forms is emphasized, particularly in clinical trials. Some patients do
not see the necessity for separate consents for biospecimens,
highlighting the importance of clear communication following ethical
guidelines.

Trust in research varies significantly, influenced by the origin of
studies and patients' ethnic backgrounds. While Canadian patients show
trust in researchers, Latino patients in the US exhibit mistrust due to
unfamiliarity with the healthcare system. Diagnostic accuracy concerns
also emerge, with patients apprehensive about the potential for
uncertain results leading to psychological distress and a loss of trust
in the medical system.

Technological advancements, particularly involving AI, are viewed
negatively by patients who fear these could undermine patient-doctor
relationships. Parents, acting as proxies for their children, express
concerns that AI could complicate decision-making and conflict with
medical experts.

Despite these concerns, some studies indicate that the potential
benefits of precision medicine outweigh the risks. However, more
comprehensive research is needed to fully understand the risk/benefit
relationships.

The review underscores the need for patient education and transparency
regarding privacy, data protection, and economic concerns. Policies to
address insurability and the effectiveness of precision medicine
applications are crucial for building trust and obtaining informed
consent. Educational programs incorporating support groups and
healthcare professionals can empower patients, enabling informed
decisions and advocacy for their interests. Psychological support and
clear communication from physicians are essential to avoid
miscommunication. Maintaining a strong patient-doctor relationship is
fundamental to practicing medicine. Further research across diverse
populations is necessary to identify and address emerging ethical issues
and risks associated with precision medicine.
