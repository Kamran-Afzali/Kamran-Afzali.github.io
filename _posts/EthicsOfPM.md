The digital transformation is chaning the landscape of health research and healthcare delivery. The rise of digital health technologies has led to the generation of both qualitative and quantitative "big data," including digital traces of our everyday behaviors. This data holds valuable information that could potentially benefit patients and caregivers. However, the rapid integration of digital health technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) into research and clinical practice raises significant ethical concerns that need to be addressed.

The governance of digital health research is currently a "wild west" with various stakeholders involved, including technology developers, funders, researchers, participants, and journal editors. The regulatory controls and standards are not currently on par to guide this convergence in the health ecosystem. Several gaps and opportunities exist in the digital health research landscape. Firstly, there are disciplinary and sector challenges, as technology makers may not understand patients' needs, computational scientists may train AI on unrepresentative datasets, and clinicians may struggle to make sense of AI-driven decisions. Secondly, there is a need to improve digital and technology literacy among various stakeholders, including policymakers, educators, regulators, clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Thirdly, there is a lack of consistent ethical and regulatory standards for evaluating and testing new digital health technologies and AI systems. Regulatory bodies and technologists may lack the necessary expertise or training to conduct appropriate risk assessments and ensure ethical practices. 

To address these gaps, several initiatives have emerged to examine the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of digital health and AI technologies. Groups like the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative, Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research (PERVADE), and Mobile Health ELSI (mHealthELSI) project aim to inform policy and governance in this largely unregulated space. However, many of these efforts are broad in scope and may lack specificity for digital health applications. While regulations are slowly emerging, stakeholders must recognize their ethical obligation to uphold the integrity of digital health research in this unregulated space. To address these challenges, literature points towards a digital health decision-making framework with five main domains: **Participant Privacy, Risks and Benefits, Access and Usability, Data Management, and Ethical Principles**. Along theses lines, implementing digital health tools requires careful consideration of ethical principles, risk/benefit assessments, privacy protection, equitable access and usability, and sound data management practices. Collective action is needed to establish ethical standards and accountability measures to ensure the responsible development and use of digital health technologies. This document is a first effort to get an outlook of ethical considerations in digital health and precision medicine research projects.


The Research Ethics Committees (RECs) emphasize the importance of inclusivity and equity in digital health studies, below we number some of the points that could be brought up RECs.

### Considerations

**Autonomy**

- Autonomy, a relatively new concept in digital healthcare, is crucial for protecting patient independence and dignity. Challenges related to autonomy include freedom of choice in treatment, informed consent, awareness of data collection and usage, and the right to know medical results. Privacy, one of the most critical ethical challenges, involves data protection, confidentiality, data sharing, and intended or unintended data uses. In the same vein, Informed Consent guarantees that patients fully understand the implications of their participation, including potential risks and benefits.

**Equity** 

- Equity is defined by equal access to digital technology and healthcare, equity in treatment, non-discrimination, data ownership, and empowerment. Here the aim is to ensure that precision medicine and digital health interventions are accessible to all populations, including underprivileged and minority groups.

**Participant Safety and Support**

- A significant portion of discussions revolves around public and patient involvement (PPI) in study design and the development of comprehensible materials. This involvement helps mitigate concerns about participant burden and frustration with the technology. Amendments to recruitment protocols are often requested to reduce participant pressure and ensure voluntary participation. Safety measures for control groups and sensitive populations are critically examined, with well-considered arrangements required. Clear and user-friendly instructions for technology usage are essential, and studies involving high-risk devices must undergo safety checks before approval.


**Psychosocial Impact**

- Similar to the point mentioned above considering the potential psychological and social effects on patients, such as anxiety from genetic information. Preventing the misuse of genetic information by employers, insurers, or other entities. Psychosocial harms and the necessity for genetic counseling are also prominent themes. Patients experience psychological distress from frequent diagnostic scans and receiving genetic test results indicating increased disease risks. This distress can affect their quality of life and adherence to treatments. 

**Conflict of Interest**

- Applicants must disclose all affiliations with sponsors and ensure that financially affiliated researchers do not consent patients. RECs place emphasis on clarifying relationships between researchers, organizations, and study locations, especially when submitted to Higher Education Institution RECs.

- The cost-benefit ratio of PM is another contentious issue. Some professionals argue that other health interventions might offer greater
benefits and deserve better funding. Reallocating resources towards improving living conditions and health-related behaviors, could potentially yield more significant health benefits. Despite these concerns, some studies indicate that PM is at least as cost-effective as conventional care, warranting further investigation into its economic viability.

**Harm Prevention**

- Harm prevention is critical, with most applications encountering barriers related to unforeseen events such as participant non-adherence or emergencies. Mechanisms must be in place to detect and address these issues swiftly, with constant contact maintained for high-risk patients. Clear reaction protocols for unexpected events, such as device failures, are essential. Proper training for staff and clinicians, sterilization of materials, and listing device contraindications are emphasized to avert potential risks.

**Data Governance**

- Data management, including storage, access, and transfer, is a significant focus. Applicants must de-identify data, clarify device ownership, and justify unconventional storage methods. Clear procedures for handling data upon participant withdrawal are required, along with secure data transfer protocols, especially in international collaborations. Anonymization and confidentiality strategies must be detailed, distinguishing between pseudonymous and anonymous data. Video and audio recording justifications are necessary, particularly regarding the duration of storage and sharing with sponsors.


### Questions

**Privacy and Confidentiality**

-   How will patient data be protected from unauthorized access and
    breaches?
-   What measures are in place to ensure data confidentiality?

**Informed Consent**

-   How will informed consent be obtained and documented?
-   Are patients provided with comprehensive information about the potential risks and benefits of the study?

**Data Governance**

-   What are the policies for data storage, sharing, and usage?
-   How will data be anonymized or de-identified to protect patient privacy?

**Equity and Access**

-   How will the project ensure equitable access to precision medicine and digital health interventions?
-   Are there strategies to include underprivileged and minority groups in the study?

**Psychosocial Impact**

-   What are the potential psychological and social effects on patients?
