The digital revolution is transforming the landscape of health research and healthcare delivery. The rise of digital health technologies has led to the generation of vast amounts of qualitative and quantitative "big data," including digital traces of our everyday behaviors. This data holds valuable information that could potentially benefit patients and caregivers. However, the rapid integration of digital health technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) into research and clinical practice raises significant ethical concerns that need to be addressed.

The governance of digital health research is currently a "wild west," with various stakeholders involved, including technology developers, funders, researchers, participants, and journal editors. There is a lack of regulatory controls or common standards to guide this convergence in the health ecosystem. It is crucial to evaluate whether these technologies are clinically effective, measure what they claim to measure, and improve access to those at highest risk of health disparities. Several gaps and opportunities exist in the digital health research landscape. Firstly, there are disciplinary and sector challenges, as technology makers may not understand patients' needs, computational scientists may train AI on unrepresentative datasets, and clinicians may struggle to manage granular data and AI-driven decisions. Secondly, there is a need to improve digital and technology literacy among various stakeholders, including policymakers, educators, regulators, clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Research is needed to understand their knowledge levels and develop targeted educational resources. Thirdly, there is a lack of consistent ethical and regulatory standards for evaluating and testing new digital health technologies and AI systems. Regulatory bodies and technologists may lack the necessary expertise or training to conduct appropriate risk assessments and ensure ethical practices. Likewise, many stakeholders lack the expertise to properly vet these technologies. Not all undergo rigorous scientific testing before deployment, putting the public at risk of using unproven or flawed products. Demonstrating real-world value through research should be a prerequisite before any digital health technology claiming clinical benefits can be used.

To address these gaps, several initiatives have emerged to examine the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of digital health and AI technologies. Groups like the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative, Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research (PERVADE), and Mobile Health ELSI (mHealthELSI) project aim to inform policy and governance in this largely unregulated space. However, many of these efforts are broad in scope and may lack specificity for digital health applications. While regulations are slowly emerging, stakeholders must recognize their ethical obligation to uphold the integrity of digital health research in this unregulated space. To address these challenges, literature points towards a digital health decision-making framework with five main domains: **Participant Privacy, Risks and Benefits, Access and Usability, Data Management, and Ethical Principles**. This framework aims to help stakeholders make sound decisions when selecting and implementing digital health technologies.

Implementing digital health tools requires careful consideration of ethical principles, risk/benefit assessments, privacy protection, equitable access and usability, and sound data management practices. While these innovations hold great potential value, a lack of rigorous vetting could exacerbate health disparities among vulnerable populations. Collective action is needed to establish ethical standards and accountability measures to ensure the responsible development and use of digital health technologies. This document is a first effort to get an outlook of ethical considerations in digital health and precision medicine research projects.


The Research Ethics Committees (RECs) emphasize the importance of inclusivity and equity in digital health studies. Here we discuss some of he points that could be brought up RECs.

**Autonomy**

Autonomy, a relatively new concept in digital healthcare, is crucial for protecting patient independence and dignity. Challenges related to autonomy include freedom of choice in treatment, informed consent, awareness of data collection and usage, and the right to know medical results. Privacy, one of the most critical ethical challenges, involves data protection, confidentiality, data sharing, and intended or unintended data uses. In the same vein, Informed Consent guarantees that patients fully understand the implications of their participation, including potential risks and benefits.

**Equity** 

Equity is defined by equal access to digital technology and healthcare, equity in treatment, non-discrimination, data ownership, and empowerment. Here the aim is to ensure that precision medicine and digital health interventions are accessible to all populations, including underprivileged and minority groups.

**Participant Safety and Support**

A significant portion of discussions revolves around public and patient involvement (PPI) in study design and the development of comprehensible materials. This involvement helps mitigate concerns about participant burden and frustration with the technology. Amendments to recruitment protocols are often requested to reduce participant pressure and ensure voluntary participation. Safety measures for control groups and sensitive populations are critically examined, with well-considered arrangements required. Clear and user-friendly instructions for technology usage are essential, and studies involving high-risk devices must undergo safety checks before approval.


**Psychosocial Impact**

Similar to the point nemtionecabove considering the potential psychological and social effects on patients, such as anxiety from genetic information. Preventing the misuse of genetic information by employers, insurers, or other entities.

**Conflict of Interest**

Applicants must disclose all affiliations with sponsors and ensure that financially affiliated researchers do not consent patients. RECs place emphasis on clarifying relationships between researchers, organizations, and study locations, especially when submitted to Higher Education Institution RECs.


**Harm Prevention**

Harm prevention is critical, with most applications encountering barriers related to unforeseen events such as participant non-adherence or emergencies. Mechanisms must be in place to detect and address these issues swiftly, with constant contact maintained for high-risk patients. Clear reaction protocols for unexpected events, such as device failures, are essential. Proper training for staff and clinicians, sterilization of materials, and listing device contraindications are emphasized to avert potential risks.

**Data Governance**

Data management, including storage, access, and transfer, is a significant focus. Applicants must de-identify data, clarify device ownership, and justify unconventional storage methods. Clear procedures for handling data upon participant withdrawal are required, along with secure data transfer protocols, especially in international collaborations. Anonymization and confidentiality strategies must be detailed, distinguishing between pseudonymous and anonymous data. Video and audio recording justifications are necessary, particularly regarding the duration of storage and sharing with sponsors.

_________________________________________

The review reveals a generally positive attitude towards Precision
Medicine (PM) among both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients,
though professionals exhibit more skepticism regarding its actual
benefits. This skepticism is attributed to the limited evidence
supporting PM compared to conventional medicine, due in part to the
smaller scale of PM clinical trials. HCPs, trained in evidence-based
medicine, often feel underprepared to interpret genomic data and select
appropriate therapies. While machine learning can aid in data
interpretation, reliance on technology without proper verification is
cautioned against, highlighting the need for enhanced training in
medical informatics. Interdisciplinary collaboration, involving
bioinformaticians and genetic counselors, is deemed essential for
effective PM implementation.

Patient education on PM is crucial for informed decision-making,
necessitating personalized approaches that account for varying levels of
health and genetic literacy. Ethnic minorities and individuals with
disabilities, who often exhibit greater distrust or face additional
barriers, require special consideration. Traditional text-based
education methods are insufficient; innovative formats like short,
accessible video sequences are suggested, especially given the
widespread use of smartphones. However, personal consultations with
professionals must complement these educational tools.

Access to PM remains a significant ethical concern, with many
professionals doubting equitable access for all patients who could
benefit. The ethical principle of justice demands that PM be available
regardless of insurance status, ethnicity, age, or location. However,
national and international disparities in healthcare funding pose
challenges to this ideal. Recruitment biases, predominantly involving
Northern European genetic data, further exacerbate inequities, leaving
other population groups with uncertain benefits from PM. Additionally,
socio-economic factors, such as travel distance to medical centers and
digital competence, can hinder access.

The cost-benefit ratio of PM is another contentious issue. Some
professionals argue that other health interventions might offer greater
benefits and deserve better funding. Critics suggest reallocating
resources towards improving living conditions and health-related
behaviors, which could potentially yield more significant health
benefits. Despite these concerns, some studies indicate that PM is at
least as cost-effective as conventional care, warranting further
investigation into its economic viability.

Data security and privacy are paramount, given the risks of genetic
information misuse by insurance companies and employers, leading to
potential genetic discrimination. Integrating genetic data into
electronic health records increases vulnerability to cyber-attacks and
human error. Limiting data collection to essential information and
ensuring patients are aware of potential data breaches are recommended.
Patients' preferences regarding genetic information disclosure must be
respected to avoid undue stress or missed opportunities for preventive
care. Informed consent processes should clearly address the implications
of incidental findings and ensure patients understand their options.

PM also raises concerns about changes in the doctor-patient
relationship. The focus on genetic data might overshadow the patient's
personal history and values, risking a reductionist view of patients as
mere genetic entities. The potential alienation due to increased
digitalization and reliance on omics-based data calls for empirical
research to understand its impact on patient care.

Despite these challenges, both patients and professionals show a high
willingness to participate in PM research, though some patients desire
compensation for their contributions, particularly if their data or
biospecimens result in significant profits for pharmaceutical companies.
The concept of reciprocity in data donation is explored, emphasizing the
need to respect patients' wishes regarding their genetic information.

Lastly, the continuous monitoring and optimization encouraged by PM,
facilitated by smartphone apps and wearables, can place additional
psychological pressure on patients. This phenomenon, described as
"patient work" or "bio-citizenship," underscores the need for further
research into the psychological effects of sustained self-monitoring and
health optimization.

This systematic review investigates patients' perspectives on the
ethical issues and risks associated with precision medicine, analyzing
24 articles from an initial pool of 914. The review highlights key
patient concerns and extends understanding of how precision medicine is
perceived in terms of ethics and potential risks.

The most prevalent concern among patients is privacy, confidentiality,
and data security. Patients across various ethnic groups express worries
about the misuse of personal data, which could lead to commercial
exploitation or impact insurance eligibility and employment
opportunities. Substance abuse patients, in particular, fear their data
might be used to resolve unsolved crimes, discouraging participation in
precision medicine research. Younger individuals focus more on data
accessibility than privacy breaches, while some patients support wider
genomic data sharing, although this may be influenced by participation
bias.

Economic implications are another significant concern, including the
costs of medical treatments and the impact on insurance. Patients worry
about the affordability of precision medicine tests and the potential
loss of insurance coverage due to genetic conditions. The Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in the US addresses some of
these concerns, but issues around insurance eligibility and employment
persist.

Psychosocial harms and the necessity for genetic counseling are also
prominent themes. Patients experience psychological distress from
frequent diagnostic scans and receiving genetic test results indicating
increased disease risks. This distress can affect their quality of life
and adherence to treatments. Specific concerns include unexpected
paternity revelations and fears of human cloning. Moreover, there is a
worry that knowing one's genetic predispositions might lead to
neglecting personal health responsibilities, emphasizing the need for
patient education.

Equitable access to precision medicine is another critical issue.
Patients fear racial discrimination and the misuse of their genetic
information against them. Historical instances, such as the Tuskegee
Syphilis Study, contribute to mistrust among certain ethnic groups.

Informed consent processes raise additional concerns. Patients are wary
of sharing their genetic information without clear communication and
understanding of future uses. The need for simple language in consent
forms is emphasized, particularly in clinical trials. Some patients do
not see the necessity for separate consents for biospecimens,
highlighting the importance of clear communication following ethical
guidelines.

Trust in research varies significantly, influenced by the origin of
studies and patients' ethnic backgrounds. While Canadian patients show
trust in researchers, Latino patients in the US exhibit mistrust due to
unfamiliarity with the healthcare system. Diagnostic accuracy concerns
also emerge, with patients apprehensive about the potential for
uncertain results leading to psychological distress and a loss of trust
in the medical system.

Technological advancements, particularly involving AI, are viewed
negatively by patients who fear these could undermine patient-doctor
relationships. Parents, acting as proxies for their children, express
concerns that AI could complicate decision-making and conflict with
medical experts.

Despite these concerns, some studies indicate that the potential
benefits of precision medicine outweigh the risks. However, more
comprehensive research is needed to fully understand the risk/benefit
relationships.

The review underscores the need for patient education and transparency
regarding privacy, data protection, and economic concerns. Policies to
address insurability and the effectiveness of precision medicine
applications are crucial for building trust and obtaining informed
consent. Educational programs incorporating support groups and
healthcare professionals can empower patients, enabling informed
decisions and advocacy for their interests. Psychological support and
clear communication from physicians are essential to avoid
miscommunication. Maintaining a strong patient-doctor relationship is
fundamental to practicing medicine. Further research across diverse
populations is necessary to identify and address emerging ethical issues
and risks associated with precision medicine.
