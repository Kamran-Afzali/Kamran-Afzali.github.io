# Agent Based Simulation

Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling complex systems composed of interacting, autonomous ‘agents’. Agents have behaviours, often described by simple rules, and interactions with other agents, which in turn influence their behaviours. By modelling agents individually, the full effects of the diversity that exists among agents in their attributes and behaviours can be observed as it gives rise to the behaviour of the system as a whole. By modelling systems from the ‘ground up’—agent-by-agent and interaction-by-interaction—self-organization can often be observed in such models. Patterns, structures, and behaviours emerge that were not explicitly programmed into the models, but arise through the agent interactions. The emphasis on modelling the heterogeneity of agents across a population and the emergence of self-organization are two of the distinguishing features of agent-based simulation as compared to other simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation and system dynamics. Agent-based modelling offers a way to model social systems that are composed of agents who interact with and influence each other, learn from their experiences, and adapt their behaviours so they are better suited to their environment.

ABM is a modeling and computational framework for simulating dynamic processes that involve autonomous agents. An autonomous agent acts on its own without external direction in response to situations the agent encounters during the simulation. Modeling a population of autonomous agents, each with its own characteristics and behaviors, that extensively interact is a defining feature of an ABS. Agent-based simulation is most commonly used to model individual decision-making and social and organizational behavior.

Several indicators of the growing interest in agent-based modelling include the number of conferences and workshops devoted entirely to or having tracks on agent-based modelling, the growing number of peer-reviewed publications in discipline-specific academic journals across a wide range of application areas as well as in modelling and simulation journals, the growing number of openings for people specializing in agent-based modelling, and interest on the part of funding agencies in supporting programmes that require agent-based models.

## Agent-based modelling and complexity

ABMS can be traced to investigations into complex systems. Complex systems consist of interacting, autonomous components; complex adaptive systems have the additional capability for agents to adapt at the individual or population levels. These collective investigations into complex systems sought to identify universal principles of such systems, such as the basis for self-organization, emergent phenomenon, and the origins of adaptation in nature. ABMS began largely as the set of ideas, techniques, and tools for implementing computational models of complex adaptive systems.

ABMS began largely as the set of ideas, techniques, and tools for implementing computational models of complex adaptive systems. Many of the early agent-based models were developed using the Swarm modelling software designed by Langton and others to model ALife (Minar et al, 1996). Initially, agent behaviours were modelled using exceedingly simple rules that still led to exceedingly complex emergent behaviours. In the past 10 years or so, available agent-based modelling software tools and development environments have expanded considerably in both numbers and capabilities.

## Structure of an agent-based model
A typical agent-based model has three elements:

- Agents, their attributes and behaviors.
- Agent relationships and methods of interaction. An underlying topology of connectedness defines how and with whom agents interact.
- Agents’ environment. Agents live in and interact with their environment, in addition to other agents.
