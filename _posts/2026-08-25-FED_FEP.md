### Federated Inference and Learning

In a previous post, we mentioned that free energy minimization extends beyond isolated agents. In federated systems, groups collectively reduce free energy through belief-sharing protocols that harmonize local inferences into global consensus. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a unifying account of self-organization across scales. Biological systems like fish schools exemplify this: individuals minimize surprise about their neighbors’ movements while collectively exhibiting complex patterns like milling or directed migration. These behaviors emerge not from explicit coordination rules but from each agent’s Bayesian belief updating under a shared generative model.

### Federated Inference: Core Principles

**Federated inference** represents an approach to distributed cognition, enabling agents to collaboratively enhance their understanding of a shared world. Within the frameworks of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, federated inference and learning emerge as natural consequences of agents striving to minimize surprise and maximize model evidence. This essay explores the principles and mechanisms underlying federated inference and learning, emphasizing the roles of shared generative models, belief sharing, active learning, and the emergence of complexity in multi-agent systems.

At its core, federated inference relies on the concept that multiple agents, each with their own perspective and sensory experiences, can collectively infer the hidden states of a shared environment more effectively than any single agent acting alone. This is achieved through the **sharing of posterior beliefs**, which allows agents to integrate information from diverse sources and refine their internal models of the world. In a federated setting, agents not only minimize their individual free energy—defined as the variational divergence between their posterior beliefs and observed outcomes—but also contribute to the minimization of a **joint free energy** at the group level. This joint free energy reflects the system-wide uncertainty and serves as a target for coordinated belief updating.

### Belief Sharing and Generative Models

This requires agents to share their beliefs and coordinate their actions in a way that maximizes the overall coherence and predictability of the system. The sharing of beliefs can be understood as a form of communication, where agents broadcast their internal states to other members of the group.

**A shared generative model** is crucial for enabling effective communication and belief sharing among agents. The generative model encodes an agent's beliefs about the causal structure of the world, including the relationships between hidden states, observations, and actions. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation.

**Belief sharing** is fundamental to realizing joint free energy minimization, distributed over ensembles of free energy minimizing processes and over the timescales at which these processes unfold. Belief sharing is most effective when agents communicate full belief distributions rather than limiting belief-sharing to a noisy gradient estimate. The precision of communicated beliefs—defined as the inverse of their variance—determines the relative weighting of signals during integration, akin to reliability-weighted updating observed in biological neural systems.

### Emergence of Collective Intelligence

As agents engage in federated inference and learning, they not only improve their individual performance but also contribute to the emergence of **collective intelligence** at the group level. Collective intelligence refers to the ability of a group to solve complex problems and make decisions that exceed the capabilities of any single member. Within the active inference framework, collective intelligence emerges from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. As free energy is minimized, **complexity** emerges within the collective. Increased accuracy in understanding the environment leads to increased complexity, reflecting the collective's ability to represent and process information about its surroundings.

Active learning and selection complement each other. In active learning, posterior parameters (beliefs about hidden states) change to minimize variational free energy—only when expected free energy (the anticipated divergence between predicted and observed outcomes) is reduced. Conversely, in active selection, prior parameters (policies or hypotheses) change to minimize expected free energy—only when variational free energy is reduced as scored with Bayesian model reduction. This reciprocal bootstrapping underwrites self-evidencing systems capable of precise and predictable exchanges with their environment.

### Hierarchical Architectures and Multi-Scale Optimization

One of the essential aspects of federated inference is its role in collective behavior. Heins et al. (2023) explore how surprise minimization governs interactions within social systems, demonstrating that agents engaged in active inference adjust their expectations and responses to align with a broader collective. This process is crucial for large-scale coordination, from ant colonies to human societies, where individuals must reconcile their local predictions with the global network’s evolving structure.

Federated architectures implement collective active inference through three core mechanisms: belief-sharing protocols, adaptive learning dynamics, and hierarchical prediction-error minimization. Belief-sharing requires agents to encode posterior beliefs into transmissible signals, a process formalized as showing the likelihood mappings from internal states to observable messages. In federated learning, this corresponds to clients transmitting model updates to a server, which aggregates them into a global belief state. Crucially, message precision (inverse variance) determines their influence during aggregation, mirroring neurobiological mechanisms where prediction errors are weighted by their reliability.

Hierarchical prediction-error minimization enables federated systems to operate across temporal and spatial scales. At the micro scale, individual agents resolve sensory prediction errors through local belief updates. At the macro scale, the collective minimizes global free energy by redistributing computational loads—as seen in federated networks that shift training tasks from energy-constrained devices to more capable neighbors. This multi-scale optimization emerges naturally from active inference principles, where agents prioritize policies (action sequences) that minimize expected free energy over both immediate and long-term horizons.

### Applications and Breakdown of Federated Inference

Biological collectives provide examples of federated active inference. For instance, fish schools achieve predator detection through distributed belief-sharing: each individual’s visual inferences about potential threats are integrated into a global vigilance state without centralized processing. Likewise, scientific communities themselves operate as federated inference systems. Researchers act as Bayesian agents updating hypotheses (beliefs) through peer-reviewed publications (belief-sharing), with the collective goal of minimizing disciplinary prediction error. The replication crisis exemplifies a breakdown in this process, where insufficient error correction allowed high-free-energy models to persist—a scenario analogous to federated systems failing to detect Byzantine clients.

Remedies inspired by active inference include preprint servers that accelerate belief propagation and meta-analytic frameworks that weight studies by their predictive precision. An interesting frontier to progress involves formalizing the "economics" of belief propagation. Agents in open federated systems may manipulate shared beliefs for self-interest, forming networks plagued by dishonest nodes. Integrating game-theoretic concepts with active inference could yield mechanisms for detecting and excluding adversarial agents while preserving decentralization. Preliminary work shows promise: by treating trust as a precision parameter in Bayesian belief updates, systems automatically downweight contributions from unreliable participants.

### Biological Inspirations and Future Protocols

Future research must also bridge the gap between biological and artificial federated systems. While machine learning focuses on parameter transmission, biological collectives like ant colonies exchange chemical signals encoding complex priors about resource locations. Developing bio-inspired federated protocols that transmit compressed generative models—rather than raw parameters—could dramatically improve communication efficiency. Moreover, formalizing the incentives, costs, and trust dynamics involved in belief propagation will be essential to ensure scalability, robustness, and fairness in distributed systems.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, federated inference and learning, as grounded in the Free Energy Principle, enable groups of agents to collectively minimize uncertainty and achieve complex, adaptive behaviors that surpass the capabilities of individuals acting alone. By sharing beliefs and operating under a common generative model, agents can harmonize local inferences into a coherent global understanding, fostering collective intelligence and emergent complexity within multi-agent systems.

However, significant challenges remain, particularly in ensuring the integrity and reliability of belief-sharing in open federated systems, where dishonest or adversarial agents can disrupt consensus and degrade system performance—issues exemplified by phenomena such as the replication crisis in scientific communities. Addressing these vulnerabilities will require the integration of game-theoretic approaches and the development of mechanisms to detect and mitigate the influence of untrustworthy participants, such as treating trust as a precision parameter in belief updates. Looking ahead, future directions include bridging biological and artificial systems by designing bio-inspired communication protocols that transmit compressed generative models for greater efficiency, and formalizing the economics of belief propagation to better manage incentives and trust in decentralized networks. These innovations will be crucial for advancing scalable, resilient, and intelligent federated systems across both natural and engineered domains.
