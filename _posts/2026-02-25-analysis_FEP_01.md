## Active Inference and Psychoanalysis: How Aligned Are the Frameworks?

The intersection between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis is a vibrant area of interdisciplinary exploration. This convergence promises to invigorate psychoanalytic theory with contemporary computational neuroscience, potentially offering new tools and perspectives for psychoanalytic psychotherapy—a field often marginalized in recent decades.

At its core, the FEP, developed by Karl Friston, is a mathematical model describing how living organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing **free energy**—a formal measure of surprise or prediction error in a probabilistic model. Active inference, a corollary of the FEP, posits that the brain is an active agent, constantly predicting and controlling its environment rather than passively receiving sensory input. This framework not only models biological and psychological processes but aspires to formalize them, inviting comparison with psychoanalytic concepts.

Yet these comparisons must be approached with philosophical caution. Psychoanalysis is interpretive and hermeneutic, grounded in narrative, clinical encounter, and symbolic meaning. In contrast, active inference is computational and mechanistic, formulated within a Bayesian probabilistic framework. The promise—and the risk—of this dialogue lies in navigating these distinct epistemologies without collapsing one into the other.



### Freud's "Project" and the Free Energy Principle

Freud’s early *Project for a Scientific Psychology* (1895) was an ambitious, if ultimately abandoned, attempt to ground psychology in the neurophysiology of his era. Despite its historical limitations, the *Project* anticipated several ideas now formalized by active inference and the FEP, such as energy flow, psychic conflict, and the brain’s drive for equilibrium.

Freud’s notion of the mind as a dynamic energy system, influenced by 19th-century physics, aligns metaphorically with the FEP’s view of the brain as a system minimizing uncertainty. In Freud’s model, concepts like *binding* (*Bindung*) and *unbinding* (*Entbindung*) describe how the nervous system processes excitation—paralleling the FEP’s distinction between prediction error (unbound energy) and coherent generative models (bound energy).

His distinction between primary (id-driven, wish-fulfilling) and secondary (ego-driven, reality-oriented) processes finds resonance in the FEP’s hierarchical generative models. In active inference, lower levels deal with raw sensory prediction errors, while higher levels encode abstract, temporally deep representations that shape perception and action. Both frameworks suggest that the mind strives for a state of minimal excitation or surprise—a homeostatic equilibrium.

However, while the analogy is intellectually evocative, it remains metaphorical: the FEP offers a formal, information-theoretic framework grounded in variational Bayesian inference, while Freud’s psychodynamics rests on speculative neurophysiology and clinical intuition. The two operate on fundamentally distinct epistemological planes.



### Dreams: Simulation or Symbol?

Psychoanalysis famously regards dreams as the “royal road to the unconscious,” revealing disguised wishes, unresolved conflicts, and repressed content. For Freud, dreams are not only expressive but also defensive: they transform unacceptable desires into symbolic narratives through *dream work*—mechanisms like condensation, displacement, and secondary revision.

From the perspective of active inference, dreaming may serve a complementary—though not identical—function. During REM sleep, the brain relaxes sensory constraints and engages in generative modeling, simulating possible future scenarios and integrating emotionally salient experiences. This “offline inference” may allow the brain to explore hypothetical states in order to refine its predictive models and minimize future surprise (cf. Hobson, Friston & Frith, 2014).

This account heuristically parallels Freud’s idea of dreams as a site of psychological work. From both perspectives, dreaming serves to metabolize affect, rehearse responses, and process emotionally loaded material. Yet the logic differs. While Freud emphasizes symbolic transformation and the censorship of unconscious wishes, active inference treats dreams as structurally constrained simulations aimed at optimizing generative models.

Thus, the alignment is partial and metaphorical: both models describe the mind’s adaptation to internal conflict and emotional overload, but they diverge in how they explain this adaptation. One prioritizes symbolic interpretation, the other formal simulation.



### Desire and Conflict: Motivational Dynamics

Freud’s theory of desire centers on the tension between instinctual drives and the regulatory functions of the ego and superego. Repression keeps unacceptable desires unconscious, yet these desires persist, shaping symptoms, dreams, and behaviors. Conflict is the engine of psychic life, and its resolution is never final.

Active inference provides a computational counterpart to this dynamic. Desire can be modeled as a prior over preferred states—probabilistic expectations about what the agent seeks to attain. These priors influence perception, cognition, and action through *policy selection*, shaping how the agent engages with the world. From this view, prediction is not neutral: it is *motivated* by expected outcomes. As Friston et al. (2017) note, “all thinking is wishful thinking” in a predictive brain.

However, while active inference formalizes motivation as precision-weighted prediction over policies, psychoanalysis treats desire as symbolic, relational, and historically embedded. To equate them too closely would risk reductionism. The computational framework can model drive and conflict in abstract terms, but it cannot easily capture the dense symbolic texture of psychic life—the meanings embedded in dreams, fantasies, and transference.



### Methodological and Epistemological Reflections

Despite the suggestive parallels, there are serious methodological and epistemological obstacles to integrating psychoanalysis and active inference:

* **Different Scientific Paradigms:** Psychoanalysis is embedded in the *hermeneutic tradition*, concerned with meaning-making and narrative coherence. Active inference is part of *formal mechanistic science*, concerned with algorithmic explanation and prediction. As Paul Ricoeur and Thomas Kuhn might note, these frameworks operate within different paradigms of inquiry.

* **Conceptual Ambiguity:** Terms like "energy," "conflict," or even "desire" carry different connotations in each system. In psychoanalysis, energy is metaphorical and affective; in the FEP, free energy is a precise mathematical quantity. Overextending these analogies risks obfuscation.

* **Empirical Generalizability:** While active inference is testable in experimental paradigms and psychiatric modeling (e.g., Moutoussis et al., 2014), psychoanalytic constructs remain resistant to quantification. Clinical data is rich but not easily formalized.

* **Critique and Caution:** Critics of psychoanalysis often cite its lack of falsifiability, while critics of the FEP warn of its potential to become a "theory of everything" that explains too much and predicts too little (cf. Bowers & Davis, 2012). The integration of both must avoid collapsing into either naïve formalism or interpretive excess.

## Conclusion

The dialogue between psychoanalysis and active inference is rich with possibility—and fraught with conceptual risk. The FEP and active inference offer a formal, computational lens through which to reinterpret some of Freud’s most enduring insights: the mind as a system under tension, perpetually negotiating between competing demands to maintain internal coherence and adapt to the world.

However, this interpretive rapprochement must be handled with epistemological care. Active inference provides elegant formalisms, but these are not substitutes for the narrative, symbolic, and relational dimensions psychoanalysis brings to understanding the human mind. The analogy between psychic energy and free energy is fruitful only insofar as it is treated as metaphor—not as an equation.

True integration, if it is possible, lies not in collapsing one framework into the other, but in allowing each to illuminate the other’s blind spots. Psychoanalysis can challenge active inference to account for affect, narrative, and transference. Active inference can offer psychoanalysis new tools for modeling conflict, adaptation, and learning. By embracing both the synergies and the tensions, we may develop a richer, more pluralistic understanding of the psyche—one that honors both its symbolic complexity and its computational structure.
