# Computational Psychiatry Meets Reinforcement Learning: Decoding Depressive Cognition Through Q-Learning Dynamics  

This investigation bridges artificial intelligence and clinical psychology by implementing a mood-modulated Bayesian Q-learning framework to simulate cognitive differences between healthy and depressed agents. Through systematic parameter adjustments grounded in psychiatric research, we demonstrate how computational models can capture essential features of depressive cognition, including pessimistic priors, self-defeating behavior patterns, and maladaptive learning dynamics. The accompanying R code provides a reproducible template for simulating these effects while maintaining mathematical rigor in reinforcement learning principles.  

## Neurocomputational Foundations of Mood-Modulated Q-Learning  

Modern reinforcement learning theory, rooted in Bellman's dynamic programming equations[4][5], provides the mathematical framework for understanding how intelligent agents learn optimal policies through environmental interaction. The standard Q-learning update rule:  

$$ Q(s_t,a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t,a_t) + \alpha[r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1},a) - Q(s_t,a_t)] $$  

becomes psychologically enriched through three key depressive modifications implemented in our code:  

1. **Pessimistic Prior Beliefs**: Depressed agents initialize action values with negative bias  
2. **Self-Defeating Action Bias**: Maladaptive preference for suboptimal choices  
3. **Mood-Dependent Exploration**: Affective state modulates decision uncertainty  

```r  
# Depressed vs Healthy Parameterization  
params_non_depressed = threshold) {  
  alpha  0) {  
  mood_update <- weight_success * reward  
} else {  
  mood_update <- weight_failure * reward  
}  
```

Depressed agents overweight failures (0.8 vs 0.5 weight) while underweighting successes (0.2 vs 0.5), implementing Beck's cognitive triad theory computationally. This creates negatively skewed mood trajectories that persist beyond environmental contingencies.  

## Simulation Results and Clinical Parallels  

The code generates two critical outputs through 200 trial simulations:  

**Cumulative Reward Trajectories**  
![Cumulative Reward Plot](https://i.imgur.com agents (red) show significantly reduced reward accumulation due to:  
1. Initial avoidance of high-probability arms (1-2)  
2. Premature exploitation of locally-optimal bad arms (3-5)  
3. Failure to correct choices after environmental shifts  

**Mood Dynamics**  
![Mood Trajectory Plot](https://i.img mood persistence in depressed agents emerges from:  
1. Stronger reaction to punishments (steeper slopes)  
2. Weaker recovery from positive events (trial 120)  
3. Baseline negative affective drift  

These computational findings align with neuroimaging studies showing altered striatal-prefrontal activation patterns during reinforcement learning in depressed patients[3].  

## Therapeutic Implications and Model Extensions  

The framework enables virtual testing of intervention strategies by modifying parameters:  

```r  
# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Simulation  
params_CBT <- list(  
  self_defeat_bias = params_depressed$self_defeat_bias * 0.5,  
  rumination_weight_failure = 0.6  
)  
```

Early experiments show partial reward accumulation recovery when gradually adjusting these parameters over trials. Future directions could incorporate:  

1. Dynamic parameter adjustment based on success history  
2. Meta-learning of belief update rules  
3. Social reward components through multi-agent systems  

## Conclusion  

This mood-modulated Q-learning implementation provides a computationally rigorous yet clinically meaningful model of depressive cognition. By grounding parameter adjustments in established psychological theories and empirical observations[3], the framework bridges AI and psychiatry through three key contributions:  

1. **Mechanistic Explanations** for maladaptive learning patterns  
2. **Quantitative Predictions** of treatment outcomes  
3. **Hypothesis Generation** for neurocognitive research  

The accompanying code serves as both research tool and pedagogical resource, demonstrating how reinforcement learning principles can advance our understanding of mental health disorders. Future work should explore hybrid architectures combining model-based planning with these affective modulation mechanisms to capture the full complexity of human decision-making.





This R script extends a mood-modulated Bayesian reinforcement learning framework by introducing between-person variability and exogenous environmental events. In a 5-armed bandit task, each of 20 simulated agents is endowed with individual-level parameters governing pessimism, self-defeating bias, mood decay, and mood influence. Notably, pessimistic prior mean and self-defeating bias are sampled from a correlated bivariate normal distribution, introducing realistic covariance in affective traits. The environment is punctuated by external events—negative at trials 50 and 180, positive at 120—which directly perturb the agent’s mood, operationalized as an exponentially smoothed function of prior rewards. Each agent selects actions using Thompson sampling, with mood dynamically modulating the variance of the sampled Q-values to shift the exploration–exploitation balance. The resulting dataset captures action choice, reward received, and mood trajectory for each agent across 200 episodes. The mood trajectories, visualized via a multi-agent time series plot, reveal heterogeneity in affective dynamics and illustrate how internal traits interact with external perturbations.

 This R script simulates a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates meta-cognitive mechanisms to model affective decision-making in “depressed” and “non-depressed” agents. Each agent interacts with a 5-armed bandit environment over 200 trials, with distinct probabilities and magnitudes of rewards. The agents implement Bayesian Q-learning, where mood modulates exploration through variance scaling, and updates to beliefs depend on a learned helplessness factor that reduces learning following repeated punishments. Two groups are defined by parameter sets that reflect psychological differences: the depressed group exhibits greater pessimism, stronger self-defeating bias, faster mood decay, and heightened susceptibility to negative feedback through lower helplessness thresholds and biased rumination (favoring negative outcomes). Thirty agents per group are simulated, and the output is summarized across trials to estimate average cumulative reward and mood. Visualizations reveal significant group differences, with depressed agents accumulating fewer rewards and displaying more negative mood trajectories, highlighting the behavioral and emotional consequences of maladaptive cognitive-affective dynamics.
