### **Collective Active Inference and Group-Level Free Energy Minimization**

The free energy principle (FEP) has emerged as a fundamental framework for understanding cognition, perception, and action across biological and artificial systems. At its core, active inference—a process derived from FEP—suggests that organisms act to minimize surprise or uncertainty by constantly updating their beliefs and engaging in goal-directed behavior. While this framework has been extensively explored in individual agents, recent research has extended active inference to collective behavior, proposing that groups, societies, and even cultures operate under the same principles of free energy minimization. This essay explores how collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization function as mechanisms for social adaptation, decision-making, and coordinated action in multi-agent systems. One crucial aspect of group-level free energy minimization is the concept of Markov blankets, which define the boundaries between an agent and its environment. At the social level, Markov blankets extend to delineate group structures, demarcating subgroups and social roles. Kirchhoff et al. (2018) argue that social Markov blankets function to maintain coherence in collective behavior by constraining information flow within and between groups. These boundaries enable modularity in collective cognition, ensuring that subgroups can specialize while still contributing to the overall functioning of the collective.

Active inference at the individual level involves a dynamic interplay between perception and action. An agent forms probabilistic models of the environment and acts to reduce discrepancies between its predictions and sensory inputs. This process is iterative, with continuous updating of internal models to minimize free energy. When applied to groups, active inference extends beyond the individual, encompassing shared generative models that facilitate coordinated action, cooperation, and even cultural evolution.

Collective active inference operates on the principle that individuals within a group do not merely act as isolated agents but participate in a distributed cognitive system. This distributed cognition enables coordinated decision-making, wherein agents share and update beliefs based on collective experiences. Heins and Ramstead (2022) propose that collective behavior arises from surprise minimization across interconnected individuals, meaning that social interactions serve to reduce uncertainty at both individual and group levels. Through federated inference and belief sharing (Friston et al., 2024), groups establish common priors and predictive models, ensuring coherence in collective actions.

A main part of the collective active inference framework  is the concept of a **shared generative model**. By equipping agents with a shared generative model of a shared world, Bayesian belief updating can be distributed across multiple agents. This distribution relies on a **common ground or frame of reference**, ensuring conserved belief structures and representations across agents. For agents to effectively share beliefs, there must be an isomorphism between their beliefs, requiring generative models with conserved belief structures. Within this context **Federated inference and learning** emerges as a concept reffering to minimizing variational, expected, and reduced free energy, offering a first-principles account of state inference, parameter learning, and model selection for any generative model and implicit agent. **Belief-sharing** plays a crucial role in resolving uncertainty about hidden states, especially when observable consequences are only visible to one agent at a time. By sharing beliefs, agents can accumulate evidence through multiple perspectives, enhancing the efficiency of belief updating. This process relies on a shared generative model, where the mapping between each agent's beliefs and expressions is conserved across agents. In scenarios where agents have complementary perspectives, communication resolves uncertainty about latent states in their shared world. Communication is a vital component of collective active inference, serving as a mechanism for synchronizing beliefs across individuals. Heyes (2018) argues that human communication itself can be understood as an active inference process, wherein interlocutors minimize uncertainty by exchanging signals that refine their shared generative models. This perspective aligns with the notion of federated inference (Friston et al., 2024), where distributed agents update their beliefs based on shared information, thereby reducing global free energy. **Linguistic communication emerges** as agents broadcast beliefs, increasing the accuracy of their world models and enhancing communication efficiency. As agents interact and share information, they develop a shared language that facilitates coordination and knowledge sharing. The structure of language inherits the structure of the underlying generative model and is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world. This perspective aligns with linguistic theories such as Universal Grammar and Optimality Theory, where constraints arise naturally from free energy minimization. 

Cumulative culture, as explored by Kastel et al. (2022), provides an example of group-level active inference in action. Culture can be seen as a form of distributed generative modeling where individuals collectively refine and transmit knowledge across generations. The emergence of cumulative culture relies on joint active inference, whereby individuals align their internal models through social learning and communication. This alignment allows for the progressive accumulation of innovations, facilitating the evolution of complex social structures and technologies. Within this context social norms and institutions can also be understood as emergent properties of group-level free energy minimization. Buskell (2020) emphasizes that normativity and social change are deeply tied to epistemic framing within a community. Norms function as shared priors that guide behavior and reduce uncertainty in social interactions. When these priors become misaligned with environmental changes, collective active inference enables their adaptation or replacement. This adaptive process ensures that social structures remain functional and resilient in the face of evolving challenges.

A significant challenge in collective active inference is the balance between individual autonomy and group-level coherence. On one hand, individuals must maintain their own predictive models to navigate personal uncertainties. On the other, they must integrate their models with those of the collective to achieve coordinated action. This tension is evident in multi-agent decision-making scenarios, such as those modeled by Levchuk et al. (2018), where agents must dynamically adapt their strategies based on context-driven collaboration. Decentralized decision-making in multi-agent systems exemplifies how active inference can scale to complex social interactions without requiring a centralized controller. Likewise, Kaufmann et al. (2021) demonstrate that collective decision-making processes can be optimized by modeling the interplay between individual cognition and group dynamics. By leveraging active inference, organizations and teams can enhance cooperation, improve problem-solving capabilities, and foster adaptive leadership structures. The implications extend to fields such as organizational psychology, artificial intelligence, and governance, where collective intelligence plays a crucial role in decision-making and strategic planning.

Collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization provide a powerful framework for understanding social behavior, cooperation, and cultural evolution. By extending active inference beyond individual agents to encompass distributed cognition, federated belief updating, and multi-agent coordination, researchers can uncover the principles governing complex adaptive systems. This theoretical approach not only enhances our understanding of human societies but also has practical applications in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to organizational management. As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the principles of collective active inference will play a vital role in shaping the future of collaborative intelligence and social adaptation. Moreover, group-level free energy minimization has profound implications for artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. By implementing active inference in AI systems, researchers aim to develop more adaptive, context-aware, and socially intelligent agents. Parr et al. (2022) highlight how active inference provides a framework for modeling human-like decision-making in autonomous systems, enabling machines to interact with humans in a more intuitive and cooperative manner.
