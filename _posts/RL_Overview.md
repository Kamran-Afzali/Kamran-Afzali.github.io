## **Understanding Reinforcement Learning: From Bandits to Policy Optimization**

### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a dynamic subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It is inspired by behavioral psychology and decision theory, involving a learning paradigm where feedback from the environment is neither supervised (as in classification tasks) nor completely unsupervised, but rather in the form of scalar rewards. The foundational concepts of RL can be understood by progressing from simple problems, such as the multi-armed bandit, to more sophisticated frameworks like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their many solution methods.

### The Multi-Armed Bandit: The Simplest Case

The journey begins with the multi-armed bandit problem, a classic formulation that captures the essence of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. In this setting, an agent must choose among several actions (arms), each yielding stochastic rewards from an unknown distribution. There are no state transitions or temporal dependencies—just the immediate outcome of the chosen action. The objective is to maximize the expected reward over time.

Despite its simplicity, the bandit framework introduces crucial ideas such as reward estimation, uncertainty, and exploration strategies. Algorithms like ε-greedy methods introduce random exploration, while Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) techniques adjust choices based on uncertainty estimates. Thompson Sampling applies Bayesian reasoning to balance exploration and exploitation. Though limited in scope, these strategies establish foundational principles that generalize to more complex environments.

### Transition to Markov Decision Processes

The limitations of bandit models become evident when we consider sequential decision-making problems where actions influence future states and rewards. This leads to the formalism of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which model environments through states, actions, transition probabilities, rewards, and a discount factor. The Markov property assumes that the future is independent of the past given the present state, simplifying the dynamics and enabling tractable analysis.

An agent operating within an MDP seeks to learn an optimal policy—a mapping from states to actions—that maximizes expected cumulative return. Solving MDPs, however, is not trivial. Different methods have been developed based on whether the model of the environment is known and what aspects of the decision process the algorithm learns—such as the value function, the policy, or both.

### Comparing Reinforcement Learning Methods

To frame this spectrum of approaches clearly, the table below summarizes key RL method families, highlighting whether they rely on an explicit model of the environment, and whether they learn policies, value functions, or both.

| Method Type         | Uses Model? | Learns Policy? | Learns Value? | Example Algorithms                |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Multi-Armed Bandits | N/A         | Yes            | No            | ε-Greedy, UCB, Thompson           |
| Dynamic Programming | Yes         | Yes            | Yes           | Value Iteration, Policy Iteration |
| Monte Carlo         | No          | Yes            | Yes           | MC Prediction, MC Control         |
| TD Learning         | No          | Yes            | Yes           | SARSA, Q-Learning                 |
| Policy Gradient     | No          | Yes            | Maybe         | REINFORCE, PPO, A2C               |
| Actor-Critic        | No          | Yes            | Yes           | A2C, DDPG, SAC                    |
| Model-Based         | Yes         | Yes            | Yes           | Dyna-Q, MuZero                    |

This classification illustrates the diversity of RL approaches and underscores the flexibility of the RL paradigm. Some methods assume access to a perfect model, while others learn entirely from data. Some directly optimize policies, while others estimate values to guide policy improvement.

### Dynamic Programming: Model-Based Learning

Dynamic Programming (DP) methods such as Value Iteration and Policy Iteration assume complete knowledge of the environment's dynamics. These algorithms exploit the Bellman equations to iteratively compute optimal value functions and policies. Value Iteration updates value estimates using the maximum expected return across all actions, while Policy Iteration alternates between evaluating the current policy and improving it.

Although DP methods guarantee convergence to the optimal policy, they are rarely applicable to real-world problems due to their assumption of known transitions and the computational infeasibility of operating over large or continuous state spaces.

### Model-Free Approaches: Monte Carlo and TD Learning

When the model is unknown, we turn to model-free methods that learn directly from sampled experience. Monte Carlo methods estimate the value of policies by averaging the total return over multiple episodes. These methods are simple and intuitive, suitable for episodic environments, but suffer from high variance and are not efficient in online learning scenarios.

Temporal Difference (TD) learning bridges the gap between Monte Carlo and DP by updating value estimates based on partial returns. Algorithms like SARSA and Q-learning fall into this category. SARSA is on-policy, updating values based on the actual trajectory taken, while Q-learning is off-policy, learning about the greedy policy regardless of the agent’s current behavior. These methods do not require waiting until the end of an episode and are thus applicable in ongoing tasks.

### Q-Learning and Function Approximation

Q-learning is one of the most widely used RL algorithms due to its simplicity and theoretical guarantees. However, when dealing with large state-action spaces, tabular Q-learning becomes infeasible. Function approximation, particularly using neural networks, allows Q-learning to scale to high-dimensional problems. This gave rise to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), where a neural network is trained to approximate the Q-function.

DQNs introduced mechanisms like experience replay—storing and reusing past interactions to reduce correlation between updates—and target networks—fixed Q-value targets updated slowly to stabilize learning. These enhancements enabled RL to tackle complex environments like Atari games directly from pixels.

### Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic Methods

While value-based methods derive policies from value functions, policy-based methods directly parameterize and optimize the policy itself. Policy Gradient methods compute the gradient of expected return with respect to policy parameters and perform gradient ascent. The REINFORCE algorithm is the archetype of this approach, but it often suffers from high variance in gradient estimates.

To address these limitations, Actor-Critic methods introduce a second component: the critic, which estimates value functions to inform and stabilize the updates of the actor (policy). Algorithms like Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) build on this architecture, each adding unique elements to improve performance and stability.

### Advanced Policy Optimization Techniques

More recent advances in policy optimization have focused on improving training stability and sample efficiency. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) constrains policy updates to stay within a trust region defined by the KL divergence, ensuring small, safe steps in parameter space. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) simplifies TRPO with a clipped objective function, striking a balance between ease of implementation and empirical performance.

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), on the other hand, incorporates an entropy maximization objective, encouraging exploration by maintaining a degree of randomness in the policy. This leads to better performance in environments with sparse or deceptive rewards and is particularly effective in continuous control tasks.

### Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

Model-based RL revisits the idea of using an explicit or learned model of the environment for planning. This approach can be more sample-efficient, as agents can simulate trajectories internally rather than relying solely on real interactions. Classical methods like Dyna-Q combine learning and planning by interleaving updates based on real and simulated experience.

Recent innovations, such as MuZero, demonstrate that it is possible to learn a model implicitly, without reconstructing full observations or transition dynamics. MuZero learns to predict value functions, policies, and rewards from abstract latent states, achieving state-of-the-art results in domains like Go and Atari games. These methods illustrate how model-based ideas can be integrated with deep learning to create highly capable RL agents.

### Conclusion and Further Directions

Reinforcement Learning has evolved into a mature and diverse field, offering a rich set of tools for decision-making under uncertainty. From simple bandit strategies to deep policy optimization and model-based reasoning, RL provides a versatile framework for learning from interaction. The field continues to advance rapidly, driven by theoretical insights, algorithmic innovation, and increasingly ambitious applications.

A solid understanding of the main categories—such as those outlined in the comparative table—is essential for navigating the RL landscape. Whether one is interested in theoretical foundations, algorithm development, or practical deployment, the key ideas of exploration, value estimation, policy optimization, and model learning form the backbone of modern RL.
