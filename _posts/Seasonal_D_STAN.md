Certainly. Here's a complete blog post on **Bayesian Seasonal Decomposition** written in a clear, academic tone with Stan and R code for full implementation. This post introduces how to decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components using a **Bayesian structural time series model**.

# **Bayesian Seasonal Decomposition in Stan and RStan**

Understanding the components that make up a time series is a critical first step in analysis and forecasting. Classical seasonal decomposition techniques, such as STL or X-11, offer ways to separate a series into **trend**, **seasonal**, and **irregular** components. However, these methods are often deterministic and lack a coherent probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification.

In contrast, **Bayesian seasonal decomposition** allows us to model uncertainty in each component explicitly. In this post, we demonstrate how to construct a **Bayesian structural time series model** in Stan, decompose a seasonal time series, and obtain posterior distributions for each latent component.

## **1. Simulating Seasonal Time Series Data**

We first simulate a synthetic time series with additive trend, seasonality, and noise:

```r
set.seed(123)
n <- 120
t <- 1:n
trend <- 0.05 * t
seasonal_period <- 12
seasonal <- rep(sin(2 * pi * (1:seasonal_period) / seasonal_period), length.out = n)
noise <- rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)
y <- trend + seasonal + noise

ts.plot(y, main = "Simulated Time Series with Trend and Seasonality")
```

---

## **2. Bayesian Seasonal Decomposition Model in Stan**

We use an additive structural model:

$$
y_t = \mu_t + \gamma_t + \epsilon_t
$$

* $\mu_t$: Local level (trend)
* $\gamma_t$: Seasonal component
* $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$: Irregular component

We impose a **local level model** for the trend:

$$
\mu_t = \mu_{t-1} + \eta_t, \quad \eta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\mu}^2)
$$

And we model seasonality with a constraint that its sum over one period equals zero (to ensure identifiability):

```stan
stan_model_1 <-'data {
  int<lower=2> N;
  int<lower=2> s;           // seasonal period
  vector[N] y;
}
parameters {
  vector[N] mu;             // trend
  vector[s] season_raw;     // raw seasonal effects
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  real<lower=0> sigma_mu;
  real<lower=0> sigma_season;
}
transformed parameters {
  vector[N] season;
  vector[s] season_clean;
  
  // Center seasonal component to sum to zero
  season_clean = season_raw - mean(season_raw);
  
  for (t in 1:N)
    season[t] = season_clean[1 + ((t - 1) % s)];
}
model {
  mu[2:N] ~ normal(mu[1:(N - 1)], sigma_mu);
  season_raw ~ normal(0, sigma_season);
  y ~ normal(mu + season, sigma);
}'
```

## **3. Fitting the Model in R**

We fit this model using RStan:

```r
library(rstan)

data_list <- list(
  N = length(y),
  s = seasonal_period,
  y = y
)

fit <- stan(
  model_code = stan_model_1,
  data = data_list,
  chains = 4,
  iter = 2000,
  warmup = 1000,
  seed = 123
)

print(fit, pars = c("sigma", "sigma_mu", "sigma_season"))
```

---

## **4. Extracting and Visualizing Components**

We now extract the posterior estimates and visualize the trend and seasonal components:

```r
posterior <- extract(fit)
mu_hat <- apply(posterior$mu, 2, mean)
season_hat <- apply(posterior$season, 2, mean)

par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))
plot(y, type = 'l', main = "Observed Time Series", ylab = "y")
plot(mu_hat, type = 'l', col = "blue", main = "Estimated Trend (mu)", ylab = "mu_t")
plot(season_hat, type = 'l', col = "darkgreen", main = "Estimated Seasonal Component", ylab = "season_t")
```

This visual decomposition gives insight into how much of the variation is driven by the underlying trend and how much by recurring seasonal patterns. The Bayesian framework also allows for full posterior uncertainty quantification, which can be visualized with credible intervals around each component.

## **5. Extensions and Applications**

Bayesian structural time series models can be extended in numerous ways. One may introduce regression components to account for covariates (leading to models like BSTS), or allow the trend to include a slope (i.e., a local linear trend). Multivariate or hierarchical seasonal decomposition is also possible and particularly useful for grouped or panel time series.

---

## **6. Conclusion**

Bayesian seasonal decomposition offers a principled approach to breaking down time series into interpretable components while rigorously accounting for uncertainty. Compared to classical methods, the Bayesian formulation in Stan provides flexibility, interpretability, and extensibility. Whether used for exploratory analysis or as a preprocessing step for forecasting, structural time series decomposition is a valuable tool in the Bayesian modelerâ€™s toolkit.

As always, the full code and Stan model are available on the linked GitHub repository. Feel free to explore variations of the model or adapt it to your own data.
