The fMRIPrep workflow takes as principal input the path of the dataset that is to be processed. The input dataset is required to be in valid BIDS format, and it must include at least one T1w structural image and (unless disabled with a flag) a BOLD series. We highly recommend that you validate your dataset with the free, online BIDS Validator.

The exact command to run fMRIPRep depends on the Installation method. The common parts of the command follow the BIDS-Apps definition.
