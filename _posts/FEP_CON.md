The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been applied to the hard problem of consciousness, with affect identified as its elemental form and its physiological mechanism located in the upper brainstem (Solms, 2019). This principle has also been used to define neural correlates of consciousness in terms of neural dynamics and computational correlates, which has implications for understanding consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behavior (Wiese, 2021). Furthermore, the FEP has been proposed as a framework for understanding the nature of volition, particularly in relation to the Libet phenomena (Safron, 2021). These studies collectively suggest that the FEP can provide a valuable framework for understanding the relationship between consciousness and the brain.


The provided sources highlight several key ways in which the free energy principle (FEP) has contributed to our understanding of consciousness and volition:

1. Relating Affect and Consciousness: The FEP framework suggests that the elemental form of consciousness is rooted in affect, the conscious feelings of emotions and drives, which originate from and terminate in the upper brainstem regions[5]. This provides a novel perspective on the physiological underpinnings of consciousness.

2. Identifying Neural Correlates of Consciousness: The FEP has facilitated the definition of neural correlates of consciousness, shedding light on the neural dynamics and computational processes that contribute to conscious experience, even in the absence of sensory stimulation or observable behavior[2][4].

3. Elucidating the Nature of Volition: The FEP framework has been proposed as a means of understanding the nature of volition, particularly in the context of phenomena such as the Libet experiments, which explore the relationship between conscious decisions and brain activity[1][5].

4. Providing a Comprehensive Framework: The FEP is seen as a potentially comprehensive framework for unraveling the intricate relationship between consciousness and the brain, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these fundamental aspects of human experience[3][4].

Overall, the sources highlight the significant contributions of the FEP in advancing our understanding of consciousness and volition, by relating affect to the elemental form of consciousness, identifying neural correlates, and providing a unifying framework for these complex phenomena.


Based on the provided sources, here are some examples of research that have used the free energy principle to study consciousness:

1. The "Inner Screen" Model of Consciousness: The first source[1] presents a model of consciousness that follows directly from the free energy principle. It identifies the elemental form of consciousness as "affect" and locates its physiological mechanism in the upper brainstem.

2. Relating Affect and Consciousness: The second and third sources[2][3] explain how the free energy principle can be applied to the "hard problem" of consciousness, suggesting that affect (conscious feelings of emotions and drives) is the elemental form of consciousness and is rooted in the upper brainstem regions.

3. Neural Correlates of Consciousness: The sources indicate that the free energy principle has facilitated the definition of neural correlates of consciousness, shedding light on the neural dynamics and computational processes that contribute to conscious experience, even in the absence of sensory stimulation or observable behavior[2][3].

4. Elucidating the Nature of Volition: The free energy principle framework has been proposed as a means of understanding the nature of volition, particularly in the context of phenomena such as the Libet experiments, which explore the relationship between conscious decisions and brain activity[2][5].

5. Potential for Assessing Artificial Consciousness: The fifth source[5] discusses how the free energy principle can provide a framework for determining whether an artificial system is genuinely conscious, by identifying the computational features that may be necessary for consciousness.

Overall, the provided sources highlight how the free energy principle has been applied to tackle the "hard problem" of consciousness, offering insights into the physiological underpinnings of consciousness, the neural correlates of conscious experience, and the potential for understanding phenomena like volition and artificial consciousness.
