The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been applied to the hard problem of consciousness, with affect identified as its elemental form and its physiological mechanism located in the upper brainstem (Solms, 2019). This principle has also been used to define neural correlates of consciousness in terms of neural dynamics and computational correlates, which has implications for understanding consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behavior (Wiese, 2021). Furthermore, the FEP has been proposed as a framework for understanding the nature of volition, particularly in relation to the Libet phenomena (Safron, 2021). These studies collectively suggest that the FEP can provide a valuable framework for understanding the relationship between consciousness and the brain.

 The FEP framework suggests that the elemental form of consciousness is rooted in affect, the conscious feelings of emotions and drives, which originate from and terminate in the upper brainstem regions. This provides a novel perspective on the physiological underpinnings of consciousness.

 The FEP has facilitated the definition of neural correlates of consciousness, shedding light on the neural dynamics and computational processes that contribute to conscious experience, even in the absence of sensory stimulation or observable behavior.

3. Elucidating the Nature of Volition: The FEP framework has been proposed as a means of understanding the nature of volition, particularly in the context of phenomena such as the Libet experiments, which explore the relationship between conscious decisions and brain activity[1][5].

4. Providing a Comprehensive Framework: The FEP is seen as a potentially comprehensive framework for unraveling the intricate relationship between consciousness and the brain, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these fundamental aspects of human experience[3][4].

Overall, the sources highlight the significant contributions of the FEP in advancing our understanding of consciousness and volition, by relating affect to the elemental form of consciousness, identifying neural correlates, and providing a unifying framework for these complex phenomena.


Based on the provided sources, here are some examples of research that have used the free energy principle to study consciousness:

1. The "Inner Screen" Model of Consciousness: The first source[1] presents a model of consciousness that follows directly from the free energy principle. It identifies the elemental form of consciousness as "affect" and locates its physiological mechanism in the upper brainstem.

2. Relating Affect and Consciousness: The second and third sources[2][3] explain how the free energy principle can be applied to the "hard problem" of consciousness, suggesting that affect (conscious feelings of emotions and drives) is the elemental form of consciousness and is rooted in the upper brainstem regions.

3. Neural Correlates of Consciousness: The sources indicate that the free energy principle has facilitated the definition of neural correlates of consciousness, shedding light on the neural dynamics and computational processes that contribute to conscious experience, even in the absence of sensory stimulation or observable behavior[2][3].

4. Elucidating the Nature of Volition: The free energy principle framework has been proposed as a means of understanding the nature of volition, particularly in the context of phenomena such as the Libet experiments, which explore the relationship between conscious decisions and brain activity[2][5].

5. Potential for Assessing Artificial Consciousness: The fifth source[5] discusses how the free energy principle can provide a framework for determining whether an artificial system is genuinely conscious, by identifying the computational features that may be necessary for consciousness.

Overall, the provided sources highlight how the free energy principle has been applied to tackle the "hard problem" of consciousness, offering insights into the physiological underpinnings of consciousness, the neural correlates of conscious experience, and the potential for understanding phenomena like volition and artificial consciousness.




The enigma of consciousness persists as one of the most confounding puzzles in philosophy and neuroscience. While it is undeniable that certain organisms possess subjective experiences, elucidating how these systems become subjects of experience poses a formidable challenge. Why is it that the engagement of our cognitive faculties with sensory information results in vivid experiences such as the color blue or the sound of a musical note? The underlying physical processes that give rise to consciousness remain elusive, leaving us with a profound mystery to unravel.

At the heart of this inquiry lies the question: How do neurophysiological activities produce the experience of consciousness? Attempts to address this question often conceptualize the brain as a producer or cause of consciousness, but such formulations may obscure rather than clarify the nature of the problem. The relationship between the brain and the mind defies simplistic causal explanations; likening consciousness to a byproduct of physiological processes fails to capture its essence.

Instead, adopting a dual-aspect monist perspective offers a fresh vantage point on the mind-body conundrum. Viewing the body and mind as two facets of the same underlying reality challenges us to reconsider our ontological assumptions. If both body and mind are manifestations of a deeper reality, what substance underpins their existence? Analogous to the relationship between thunder and lightning, this question leads us to ponder the metaphysical equivalent of "electricity" in the realm of consciousness.

Clarifying the ontological status of terms like "physical basis" and "neurobiological processes" requires a nuanced understanding of their underlying meaning. Rather than viewing physiological phenomena as distinct from their mental counterparts, we must recognize their interconnectedness. Memory, for instance, is not a tangible entity but a functional process that manifests both psychologically and physiologically. By abstracting underlying functional laws from observable phenomena, we can bridge the apparent gap between conscious experience and its neural correlates.

Considerations of short-term and long-term memory reveal the interplay between psychological experiences and physiological processes. Laws governing memory capacity and consolidation arise from both psychological observations and neurophysiological data, highlighting the intricate relationship between mind and body. Ultimately, our quest for understanding consciousness must transcend superficial explanations and delve into the realm of abstract functional laws.

In our pursuit of elucidating the mysteries of consciousness, we encounter not only conceptual challenges but also epistemological hurdles. Identifying the fundamental laws that govern conscious experience necessitates a rigorous inquiry into the nature of reality itself. Yet, it is through such intellectual endeavors that we inch closer to unraveling the enigma of consciousness and unlocking the secrets of the mind.



The journey through the intricacies of consciousness leads us to a fundamental realization: the level of consciousness is intricately tied to variational free energy. Drawing parallels between thermodynamic concepts and neurophysiological processes, we discern that arousal, the cornerstone of wakefulness, is underpinned by surprisal and uncertainty. This conceptual framework, rooted in the mathematics of information theory, brings us closer to Helmholtz's ideal of describing consciousness through a physical-mathematical lens.

The inquiry into the nature of consciousness extends to decorticate animals and children, challenging conventional notions of cortical centrality in consciousness. Observations of emotional and orienting reactions in such beings point to the existence of a basic form of consciousness, rooted in subcortical structures. The efficacy of deep brain stimulation in evoking affective responses further underscores the pivotal role of upper brainstem and limbic circuits in generating subjective states.

Contrary to the prevailing view, which posits the cortex as the seat of consciousness, mounting evidence suggests that consciousness emanates from subcortical regions. The cortex, rather than generating consciousness, may serve as a facilitator or stabilizer of affective arousal, transforming it into conscious cognition. This reinterpretation aligns with the remarkable plasticity of the cortex and the hierarchical dependency between brainstem arousal and cortical consciousness.

In essence, consciousness emerges as fundamentally affective, rooted in the arousal processes of the upper brainstem. This reformulation challenges traditional paradigms and prompts a reevaluation of the functional mechanisms underlying consciousness. While questions persist regarding the inner workings of consciousness, this paradigm shift offers a promising avenue for unraveling its mysteries and shedding light on the essence of subjective experience.
