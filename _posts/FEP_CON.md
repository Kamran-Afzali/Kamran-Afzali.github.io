Here we discuss the Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been applied to the hard problem of consciousness, with affect identified as its elemental form and its physiological mechanism located in the upper brainstem. This principle has been used to define neural correlates of consciousness in terms of neural dynamics and computational correlates, which has implications for understanding consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behavior. The exploration of consciousness, from both philosophical and neuroscientific perspectives, reveals a multifaceted problem that requires further understanding. Consciousness emerges not merely as a byproduct of neurophysiological activities but as a profound interplay between mind and body. Memory, as both a psychological and physiological process, underscores the interconnectedness between mental and physical phenomena. Affective states form the basis of consciousness, with emotional learning supplementing innate predictions and shaping conscious experiences. This integration of affective and cognitive consciousness underscores the fundamental role of emotions in guiding adaptive behavior and learning, providing a nuanced understanding of the subjective nature of consciousness. The Free Energy Principle offers a theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of consciousness rooted in neurophysiological dynamics. Markov blankets establish boundary conditions, separating self-organizing systems from the external environment and giving rise to subjective observational perspectives. Consciousness, as a mechanism for monitoring internal states in relation to external forces, is inherently tied to affective processes that guide adaptive behavior. This integration of affective and cognitive consciousness provides insights into the fundamental nature of subjective experience, bridging the gap between philosophical inquiry and empirical findings in neuroscience. Ultimately, the exploration of consciousness invites a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between mind and body, shedding light on one of the most enduring mysteries of human existence.




The enigma of **consciousness** is one of the most difficult puzzles in philosophy and neuroscience. While it is undeniable that certain organisms possess subjective experiences, description of how these systems become subjects of experience is a challenge. Why is it that the engagement of our cognitive faculties with sensory information results in vivid experiences such as the color blue or the sound of a musical note? The underlying physical processes that give rise to consciousness remain unclear. How do neurophysiological activities produce the experience of consciousness? Attempts to address this question often conceptualize the brain as a producer or cause of consciousness, but such formulations may further complicate rather than clarify the nature of the problem. The relationship between the brain and the mind is not that of a simplistic causal explanations and presenting consciousness to a byproduct of physiological processes fails to capture its essence.

Instead, viewing the body and mind as two facets of the same underlying reality challenges us to reconsider our ontological assumptions. If both body and mind are manifestations of a deeper reality, what substance underpins their existence? Analogous to the relationship between thunder and lightning, this question leads us to ponder the metaphysical equivalent of "electricity" in the realm of consciousness. Clarifying the ontological status of terms like "physical basis" and "neurobiological processes" requires a nuanced understanding of their underlying meaning. Rather than viewing physiological phenomena as distinct from their mental counterparts, we must recognize their interconnectedness. Memory, for instance, is not a tangible entity but a functional process that manifests both psychologically and physiologically. By abstracting underlying functional laws from observable phenomena, we can bridge the apparent gap between conscious experience and its neural correlates.

In our pursuit of elucidating the mysteries of consciousness, we encounter not only conceptual challenges but also epistemological hurdles. Identifying the fundamental causal processess that govern conscious experience necessitates researching the nature of reality itself and how organisms interact with the _reality_ of their environment.
The journey through the intricacies of consciousness leads us to a fundamental realization: the level of consciousness is tied to **free energy**. Drawing parallels between thermodynamic concepts and neurophysiological processes, we have already claimed the that arousal (yet free energy), is the cornerstone of wakeful interaction with the environment. This latter is underpinned by surprisal and uncertainty. 

Contrary to the view, which posits the cortex as the seat of consciousness, recent evidence suggests that consciousness emanates from subcortical regions. The cortex, rather than generating consciousness, may serve as a facilitator or stabilizer of affective arousal, transforming it into conscious cognition. This reinterpretation aligns with the remarkable plasticity of the cortex and the hierarchical dependency between brainstem arousal and cortical consciousness. Studies of emotional and cognitive reactions in such beings point to the existence of a basic form of consciousness, rooted in subcortical structures. The efficacy of deep brain stimulation in evoking affective responses further highlights the role of upper brainstem and limbic circuits in generating subjective states.In this view, consciousness emerges as fundamentally affective, rooted in the arousal processes of the upper brainstem. This reformulation challenges traditional paradigms and prompts a reevaluation of the functional mechanisms underlying consciousness. 


The question of **why we feel** is central inquiry in contemporary neuroscience. At its core, feeling is understood as the registration of bodily states within a biological scale of values, where pleasurable feelings signal improving chances of survival and reproductive success, while unpleasurable feelings signify deteriorating conditions. Feelings are not localized in the cortex but originate in the brainstem and limbic system, encompassing both autonomic and intrinsic brain states. As mentionedcabove the shift in focus to the brainstem highlights the primal nature of consciousness, serving as a mechanism for organisms to monitor and regulate deviations from homeostatic equilibrium in unpredictable contexts. Feeling, in this context, enables organisms to prioritize actions and make adaptive choices based on the assessment of relative value attached to different alternatives. Pleasure accompanies a return to homeostasis, while unpleasure signifies deviation from it, prompting the organism to take corrective action. Emotional valence, arising from deviations in homeostatic settling points, serve as signals guiding behavior and learning. By prioritizing needs and opportunities, consciousness emerges as a biological imperative, facilitating survival and adaptation in novel environments. Anatomically, the realization of consciousness involves a complex interplay between body-monitoring at lower levels and higher brain regions, culminating in the processing of affective information in the periaqueductal gray. Here, ongoing evaluations of environmental events and internal states inform perception and action selection, integrating external and internal uncertainties to guide behavior. Ultimately, consciousness is quintessentially affective, rooted in the primal imperative of maintaining biological integrity and adapting to the challenges of life. It is through feeling that organisms navigate the uncertainties of existence, ensuring their continued survival and success in the ever-changing landscape of the world.

**Homeostasis**, crucial for the existence and persistence of self-organizing systems like living organisms. Self-organizing systems resist entropy by occupying preferred states, thus maintaining their integrity over time. Three conditions must be met for a system to resist entropy: the presence of a boundary separating internal and external states, a mechanism to register dissipative external forces (sensory states), and a mechanism to counteract these forces (action). The concept of a Markov blanket, which establishes boundary conditions and separates the system from the external environment, is central to this explanation. The sensory and active capacities of the blanket allow the system to vicariously infer external states and act upon them based on sensory impressions. This necessitates the incorporation of a model of the world, which serves as the basis for perception and action. Through ongoing processes of hypothesis testing, the system updates its model, optimizing its predictions and minimizing free energy. In the context of nervous systems, all other bodily systems are considered external, with the nervous system performing meta-homeostatic functions on their behalf. Nervous systems co-evolved with other bodily systems to orchestrate multiple homeostatic demands, thus regulating the organism as a whole. The mechanisms this meta-homeostasis involve both physiological and psychological processes, with abstract concepts like inference, belief, and prediction. This abstract ontology allows for a unified explanation of homeostasis and its role in the function of consciousness, bridging the gap between physiological and psychological phenomena.



 Solms (2013, 2014) and further Friston (2018) claim that the  **The emergence of consciousness** is rooted in the dynamics of free energy minimization and uncertainty. Initially proposed as the basic function of homeostasis, free energy minimization is performed by brainstem nuclei centrally implicated in the generation of consciousness. Fundamental properties of minds, such as selfhood and intentionality, arise from the dynamics of a Markov blanket, which separates the system from the external environment. The imperative for self-organizing systems to monitor their internal states in relation to external forces leads to the emergence of subjective observational perspectives and active forms of subjectivity. The existence of a Markov blanket also addresses the problem of other minds, as internal states can only be registered vicariously via sensory impressions. In other words, **Consciousness emerges as self-organizing systems monitor their internal states** in relation to potentially annihilatory forces, leading to inherently value-laden processes that is predicated upon the imperative of survival. While proto-mental dynamics involve the computation of subjective values at the level of autonomic homeostasis, the transition to conscious, qualitative mental states revolves around increasing complexity. Qualitative fluctuations in affect arise from continuous comparisons between predicted and actual sensory states, signaling changes in uncertainty and expected consequences of action. This process of precision optimization is inherently affective, with affect playing a central role in engaging with the outside world and determining subjective engagement.

The **emergence of conscious self-states** is fundamentally rooted in affective states, serving as an alarm mechanism guiding self-organizing systems through situations beyond their preferred states. While instinctual behaviors provide innate survival tools, they cannot address the complexities of actual environmental niches. Consequently, innate predictions are supplemented through learning from experience, leading to emotional responses when predictions fail to capture all variance.

Emotional learning aims to automatize acquired predictions, resembling innate ones in functional properties and subcortical anatomical localization. Non-declarative memories, associated with subcortical systems, involve simpler cause-and-effect links and cannot be retrieved as mental images. Declarative memories, processed in cortical systems, readily return long-term memory (LTM) traces to conscious working memory for updating.

Conscious cognitive processes, involving cortical consciousness, delay motor responses to affective demands, enabling thinking. The essential function of cortex is stabilizing non-declarative executive processes, elevating them to a higher cathectic level, i.e., the bound state, characteristic of working memory.

The reversal of consolidation through reconsolidation renders LTM-traces labile, facilitating iterative problem-solving through conscious reconsolidation. Perceptual/cognitive consciousness, activated via attention, is also a product of uncertainty, with cortical memory-traces being more uncertain and plastic than subcortical ones.

Both exteroceptive and interoceptive sensory-motor modalities are flavored by consciousness, facilitating compartmentalization of data and reducing computational complexity while navigating uncertain conditions.

Overall, these formulations provide the foundation for an integrated theory of affective and cognitive consciousness, offering insights into the nature of consciousness and the unconscious.
