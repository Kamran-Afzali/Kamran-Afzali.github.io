The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been applied to the hard problem of consciousness, with affect identified as its elemental form and its physiological mechanism located in the upper brainstem (Solms, 2019). This principle has also been used to define neural correlates of consciousness in terms of neural dynamics and computational correlates, which has implications for understanding consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behavior (Wiese, 2021). Furthermore, the FEP has been proposed as a framework for understanding the nature of volition, particularly in relation to the Libet phenomena (Safron, 2021). These studies collectively suggest that the FEP can provide a valuable framework for understanding the relationship between consciousness and the brain.
