Machine learning grants intelligent computer systems the ability to autonomously handle tasks, pushing the boundaries of innovation across industries. Through the integration of high-performance computing, contemporary modeling, and simulations, machine learning has become a crucial tool for managing and analyzing vast amounts of data. However, it's important to acknowledge that machine learning doesn't always solve problems or yield optimal solutions. Despite the consensus that we are in an artificial intelligence golden age, significant challenges persist in developing and applying machine learning technology. Overcoming these obstacles is vital to fully unleash the potential of machine learning and its transformative influence on diverse sectors.

One major challenge lies in data quality, where subpar data can lead to inaccurate predictions due to confusion and misinterpretation. Additionally, data scarcity poses a considerable hurdle, as obtaining sufficient, labeled data can be costly and challenging. Data privacy and fairness are also concerns, necessitating ethical and secure practices to mitigate risks associated with synthetic data.

Addressing these challenges is crucial to harnessing the complete potential of machine learning and its impact on various industries. Synthetic data, artificially generated through computer algorithms or simulations, plays a vital role, especially when real data is either unavailable or needs to be kept private. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art approaches for synthetic data generation in machine learning research, covering domains, generative models, privacy concerns, evaluation strategies, and future research avenues.
