**fairness**

The challenge of fairness arises when generating synthetic data that accurately reflects the key statistical characteristics of real-world data. However, these synthetic datasets can inadvertently carry biases from data preprocessing, collection methods, and the algorithms used. Addressing fairness in synthetic data involves three main methods: preprocessing, in-processing, and postprocessing. Preprocessing modifies the input data to eliminate correlations with sensitive attributes, often using techniques like massaging, reweighting, or sampling. In contrast, in-processing integrates fairness constraints into the model learning process, while postprocessing adjusts model predictions after training. Existing fairness-aware data synthesis methods primarily utilize preprocessing techniques, leveraging balanced synthetic datasets from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to mitigate disparate impact caused by imbalances in minoritized subgroups.

However, the preprocessing approach requires prior knowledge of all correlations, biases, and variable distributions in existing datasets. The latter two methods (in-processing and postprocessing) are less developed for ensuring fairness in synthetic data. Additionally, the introduction of differential privacy amplifies fairness concerns in the original data, particularly affecting the influence of majority subgroups and reducing synthetic data utility in downstream tasks. Fairness metrics for synthesized data have been proposed to analyze covariate-level disparities, considering protected attributes to assess bias. It's crucial to regulate the real-world data used to create the synthetic data distribution, ensuring the quality and minimizing biases. Moreover, ongoing scrutiny and the removal of sensitive and toxic information from both data and models are necessary to govern the outcomes generated by foundation models and prevent harm and discrimination.

**Assuring Reliability**

In the era of data-powered decision-making across various sectors, the emergence of synthetic data has gained traction. Synthetic data, artificially generated to mimic real-world scenarios, offers a workaround for challenges linked to real data, such as privacy issues, scarcity, and data collection complexities. However, the credibility of synthetic data remains a topic of ongoing discussion, pivoting on elements like data fidelity, privacy safeguarding, and potential prejudices.

To be reliable, synthetic data must accurately mirror the statistics of the original data, encompassing its inherent diversity and structure. The peril lies in oversimplifying or distorting the complexities present in real-world data, possibly resulting in erroneous conclusions or ineffective solutions during analysis or modeling. Privacy preservation stands as a critical aspect in the creation of synthetic data. It is frequently utilized in situations where using real data might breach privacy regulations or ethical boundaries. Although synthetic data offers a degree of anonymity, debates persist about its potential for de-anonymization.

Furthermore, potential biases in synthetic data pose a significant worry. Despite being artificially generated, synthetic data often relies on real-world data for its formation. Consequently, if the real-world data is biased, these biases might inadvertently seep into the synthetic data, perpetuating flawed patterns and undermining its trustworthiness.

Additionally, evaluating the trustworthiness of synthetic data involves scrutinizing the methods employed in its creation. Transparency in the generation process, including a clear comprehension of the underlying algorithms and parameters, plays a vital role in assessing the trustworthiness of the resulting synthetic data.

In summary, while synthetic data offers substantial advantages, its credibility relies on its faithfulness to the original data, preservation of privacy, and avoidance of biases. Acknowledging and tackling these concerns empowers researchers and professionals to make well-informed decisions regarding the authenticity and ethical implications of synthetic data. Open and robust methods for generating synthetic data are crucial in nurturing this credibility.


**Evaluation Approaches**

In this section, we explore different methodologies for assessing the quality of synthetic data, a crucial aspect in ascertaining the effectiveness and relevance of synthetic data generation techniques in real-world contexts. We classify these assessment approaches as follows:

1. **Human Assessment**: Directly evaluating synthesized data involves seeking feedback from domain experts or non-experts to judge aspects like similarity to real data, usability in specific applications, or overall quality. For instance, in speech synthesis, evaluators blindly rate both synthesized and real human speech. However, this method has drawbacks, including high cost, time intensiveness, susceptibility to errors, and limited scalability. It's particularly challenging for high-dimensional data not easily visualized by humans.

2. **Statistical Comparison**: This approach entails calculating diverse statistical metrics on both synthetic and real datasets and comparing the outcomes. For example, statistics on features like medical concept frequency or patient-level clinical attributes can be employed to evaluate generated electronic health record (EHR) data. Smaller differences in statistical properties between synthetic and real data indicate higher quality in the synthetic dataset.

3. **Model-based Evaluation**: Utilizing a pre-trained machine learning model, especially the discriminator in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), helps distinguish between synthetic and real data. The performance of the discriminator on synthetic data serves as an indicator of the realism achieved by the generator, allowing assessment not only in GANs but also in other generative models using pre-trained machine learning models.

4. **Training and Testing on Real Data**: Here, synthetic data is utilized to train machine learning models, and their predictive performance is evaluated on real test data in downstream applications. Strong performance on real test data suggests successful capture of essential real data characteristics, establishing synthetic data as a valuable proxy for training. This strategy offers insights into the effectiveness of synthetic data in training machine learning models across various tasks and domains.

5. **Domain-specific Evaluation**: Depending on the specific domain or application, specialized evaluation techniques tailored to unique requirements, like regulatory compliance, privacy considerations, or specific performance metrics, may be employed to assess the synthesized data's quality. By evaluating synthesized data in its intended use context, a more precise assessment of its quality and suitability can be achieved.

These evaluation strategies offer diverse avenues to measure the quality of synthesized data, aiding researchers and professionals in determining the efficacy of synthetic data generation methods in real-world scenarios. Employing a blend of these strategies can furnish a comprehensive understanding of the synthetic data's strengths and weaknesses, facilitating ongoing enhancements in synthetic data generation techniques.
