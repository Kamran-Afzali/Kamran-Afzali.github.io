SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) and Q-learning are both reinforcement learning algorithms used to find the optimal policy for an agent in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). They are model-free, temporal-difference (TD) methods, meaning they learn directly from experience without requiring a model of the environment. Below, I’ll explain the key differences between SARSA and Q-learning, provide their mathematical formulations, and illustrate with an example.

### **Key Differences Between SARSA and Q-Learning**

1. **On-policy vs. Off-policy**:
   - **SARSA**: On-policy algorithm. It updates the Q-value based on the action actually taken by the current policy (e.g., ε-greedy policy) in the next state.
   - **Q-learning**: Off-policy algorithm. It updates the Q-value based on the best possible action (maximum Q-value) in the next state, regardless of the policy followed.

2. **Exploration Handling**:
   - **SARSA**: Because it’s on-policy, SARSA accounts for the exploration strategy (e.g., ε-greedy) in its updates. This makes it more cautious, as it learns the value of the policy including exploratory actions.
   - **Q-learning**: Ignores the exploration strategy in its updates, assuming the agent will take the optimal action in the next state. This makes it more optimistic about future rewards.

3. **Convergence**:
   - **SARSA**: Converges to the optimal policy if the policy becomes greedy in the limit with infinite exploration (GLIE) and the learning rate satisfies certain conditions.
   - **Q-learning**: Converges to the optimal policy even with a fixed exploration strategy, as it directly estimates the optimal Q-values.

4. **Behavior in Risky Environments**:
   - **SARSA**: Tends to avoid risky actions because it learns the value of the policy, including exploratory moves. It’s safer in environments with negative rewards (e.g., cliffs).
   - **Q-learning**: May take riskier actions because it assumes optimal future behavior, which can lead to higher rewards but also higher risks.

### **Mathematical Formalism**

Both algorithms update a Q-value function \( Q(s, a) \), which estimates the expected cumulative reward for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \) and following the policy thereafter. They use temporal-difference learning, combining the observed reward with an estimate of future rewards.

#### **SARSA Update Rule**
SARSA updates the Q-value based on the current state \( s \), action \( a \), reward \( r \), next state \( s' \), and the next action \( a' \) chosen by the current policy:
\[
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
\]
Where:
- \( \alpha \): Learning rate (0 < α ≤ 1).
- \( \gamma \): Discount factor (0 ≤ γ < 1), weighting future rewards.
- \( r \): Immediate reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( s' \): Next state.
- \( a' \): Next action chosen in state \( s' \) based on the current policy (e.g., ε-greedy).

#### **Q-Learning Update Rule**
Q-learning updates the Q-value based on the maximum Q-value of the next state, regardless of the action taken:
\[
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
\]
Where:
- The terms are the same as in SARSA, except \( \max_{a'} Q(s', a') \) selects the highest Q-value for any action in the next state \( s' \), assuming optimal future behavior.

### **Example: Cliff Walking**

Consider a 4x12 gridworld (Cliff Walking problem):
- **States**: Grid cells (4 rows, 12 columns).
- **Actions**: Up, Down, Left, Right.
- **Goal**: Reach the goal state (bottom-right cell) starting from the bottom-left cell.
- **Rewards**: 
  - -1 for each step (to encourage reaching the goal quickly).
  - -100 for falling off the cliff (bottom row, columns 2 to 11).
  - 0 for reaching the goal.
- **Cliff**: The bottom row (except start and goal) is a cliff. If the agent falls, it receives -100 and returns to the start.
- **Policy**: ε-greedy (ε = 0.1, meaning 90% chance of choosing the action with the highest Q-value, 10% chance of random action).
- **Parameters**: \( \alpha = 0.1 \), \( \gamma = 0.9 \).

#### **Scenario**
The agent is in state \( s \) (row 3, column 1), takes action \( a \) (Right), moves to state \( s' \) (row 3, column 2), and receives reward \( r = -1 \). The cliff is directly below (row 4, column 2).

##### **SARSA**
- The agent selects the next action \( a' \) in \( s' \) using the ε-greedy policy. Suppose it chooses \( a' = \text{Up} \) (to avoid the cliff).
- Assume current Q-values: \( Q(s', \text{Up}) = -10 \), \( Q(s, \text{Right}) = -15 \).
- SARSA update:
  \[
  Q(s, \text{Right}) \leftarrow -15 + 0.1 \left[ -1 + 0.9 \cdot (-10) - (-15) \right]
  \]
  \[
  = -15 + 0.1 \left[ -1 - 9 + 15 \right] = -15 + 0.1 \cdot 5 = -14.5
  \]
- SARSA updates \( Q(s, \text{Right}) \) to -14.5, reflecting the value of moving right and then choosing a safe action (Up).

##### **Q-Learning**
- Q-learning uses the maximum Q-value in \( s' \). Suppose \( Q(s', \text{Up}) = -10 \), \( Q(s', \text{Right}) = -12 \), \( Q(s', \text{Down}) = -100 \) (leads to cliff), \( Q(s', \text{Left}) = -15 \).
- Maximum Q-value: \( \max_{a'} Q(s', a') = -10 \) (for Up).
- Q-learning update:
  \[
  Q(s, \text{Right}) \leftarrow -15 + 0.1 \left[ -1 + 0.9 \cdot (-10) - (-15) \right]
  \]
  \[
  = -15 + 0.1 \left[ -1 - 9 + 15 \right] = -15 + 0.1 \cdot 5 = -14.5
  \]
- The update is the same in this case, but if the next action were risky (e.g., Down), SARSA would account for that risk, while Q-learning assumes the best action (Up).

#### **Behavioral Difference**
- **SARSA**: Learns a safer path, avoiding the cliff, because it updates based on the actual policy (which may choose safer actions due to exploration).
- **Q-Learning**: May learn a path closer to the cliff, as it assumes optimal actions in the future, potentially underestimating the risk of falling.

#### **Outcome**
- After many episodes, SARSA converges to a safer policy, staying away from the cliff to avoid the -100 penalty during exploration.
- Q-learning converges to the optimal policy, which may involve walking along the cliff’s edge to minimize steps (-1 per step), as it assumes perfect future actions.

### **When to Use**
- **SARSA**: Better for environments where exploration can lead to significant penalties (e.g., robotics, real-world systems). It learns safer policies.
- **Q-Learning**: Better for environments where the optimal policy is desired, and exploration risks are less critical (e.g., simulations, games).
