- **Action Value**: Q^œÄ(s,a) = Œ£_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + Œ≥ Œ£_{a'} œÄ(a'|s')Q^œÄ(s',a')]
- **Optimality (State)**: V*(s) = max_a Œ£_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + Œ≥V*(s')]

## Function Approximation Fundamentals in Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made remarkable progress, largely by moving from **tabular methods**, which store values for every state, to **deep learning** approaches that can handle vast, continuous environments. This leap, however, is built upon a critical intermediate step: **classical function approximation**. Understanding linear function approximation, basis functions, and feature engineering is essential for grasping why deep RL works, diagnosing its failures, and designing effective agent representations.

Tabular RL is impractical for large or continuous state spaces due to the **curse of dimensionality**. Function approximation overcomes this by learning a parameterized function that generalizes knowledge across similar states. This generalization is both a strength and a challenge. It allows agents to learn in complex worlds but introduces a fundamental tradeoff between **discrimination** (distinguishing important states) and **generalization** (sharing knowledge) that shapes all modern RL algorithms.

This appendix bridges the gap between tabular methods and deep RL. We begin with feature engineering, then cover the mathematical principles of linear function approximation, and finally explore classical basis functions like coarse coding, tile coding, and radial basis functions (RBFs).


## Feature Engineering and State Representation

The success of any RL algorithm hinges on the quality of its state representation. Raw environmental observations are rarely optimal for learning. Effective **feature engineering** transforms high-dimensional, noisy data into a compact, informative format that accelerates learning and improves generalization.

### The Discrimination vs. Generalization Tradeoff

At the core of feature design is a fundamental tension:

  * **Discrimination** is the ability to distinguish between states that require different actions or have different values. For example, a robot navigating near a cliff must have features that are highly sensitive to small changes in its position.
  * **Generalization** is the ability to treat similar states similarly, allowing experiences in one state to inform decisions in others. In the same navigation task, large open areas should be represented similarly so the agent doesn't have to re-learn how to move in each one.

Mathematically, we approximate a value function $V^\*(s)$ with a parameterized function $V\_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(s)$. Using a linear model, this is expressed as:

$$V_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(s) = \boldsymbol{\phi}(s)^T \boldsymbol{\theta} = \sum_{i=1}^d \phi_i(s) \theta_i$$

Here, $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(s)$ is the feature vector for state $s$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is the weight vector we learn. The quality of the approximation depends on how well the features $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(s)$ can represent the true value function $V^*(s)$. The unavoidable error in the best possible linear approximation is given by $|V^* - \\Pi V^\*|^2$, where $\\Pi$ is the projection operator onto the space spanned by the features. A good feature set minimizes this error.

### Principles of Feature Extraction

Effective feature design in RL often involves:

  * **Encoding Temporal Dependencies**: Features should capture dynamics, such as position and velocity in a physics problem or recent price trends in a trading algorithm.
  * **Focusing on Action-Relevant Information**: Features should highlight aspects of the state that are critical for making a decision. The shape of a chess position is more important than the specific pieces if the underlying tactical pattern is the same.
  * **Capturing Hierarchical Structure**: Good features can represent abstract concepts, like "in the kitchen" for a home robot or "opening phase" in a board game, which allows for hierarchical planning and learning.


## Mathematical Foundations of Linear Function Approximation

Linear function approximation is the cornerstone of parametric value function methods. Its simplicity provides theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency, making it an essential starting point.

### Linear Value Functions

We represent the state-value function $V(s)$ or action-value function $Q(s, a)$ as a linear combination of features:
$$V_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(s) = \boldsymbol{\phi}(s)^T \boldsymbol{\theta}$$
$$Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(s, a) = \boldsymbol{\phi}(s, a)^T \boldsymbol{\theta}$$
A key advantage is that the gradient of the value function with respect to the parameters is simply the feature vector itself:
$$\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} V_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(s) = \boldsymbol{\phi}(s)$$
This property makes learning algorithms based on gradient descent straightforward and computationally cheap.

### Temporal Difference (TD) Learning with Function Approximation

With linear function approximation, the **TD(0)** update rule for learning $V\_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(s)$ becomes:
$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{\theta}_t + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma V_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(S_{t+1}) - V_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(S_t)] \boldsymbol{\phi}(S_t)$$
This update adjusts the weights $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ to reduce the TD error for the observed transition. Since the value of any state depends on the shared weights $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, this single update influences the value estimates across the entire state space.

Similarly, the update for **Q-learning** is:
$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{\theta}_t + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(S_{t+1}, a') - Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(S_t, A_t)] \boldsymbol{\phi}(S_t, A_t)$$

### Convergence and the "Deadly Triad"

While on-policy TD learning with linear function approximation is guaranteed to converge, stability is not assured under all conditions. The combination of **off-policy learning**, **function approximation**, and **bootstrapping** (updating estimates from other estimates) is known as the **"deadly triad"** and can lead to divergence, where the value estimates grow uncontrollably. This instability is a fundamental challenge that motivated much of the research leading to modern deep RL algorithms like DQN, which employ techniques like experience replay and target networks to mitigate it.


## Classical Basis Function Methods

Basis functions are systematic methods for constructing features. They provide a bridge from simple linear models to the powerful, automatically-learned features of neural networks.

### Coarse Coding

**Coarse coding** uses overlapping binary features, where each feature corresponds to a "receptive field" or region in the state space. A feature is active (value 1) if the state falls within its region and inactive (0) otherwise. The overlap between regions enables generalization: nearby states activate a similar set of features, so they receive similar value estimates.

The degree of overlap controls the smoothness of the learned function. More overlap leads to broader generalization.

```r
# Load necessary libraries for all visualizations
library(ggplot2)
library(ggforce) # For drawing circles

# --- Coarse Coding Implementation ---
create_coarse_coder <- function(state_dims, num_features, overlap_factor = 2) {
  # Generate random centers for the receptive fields
  centers <- data.frame(
    x = runif(num_features, 0, state_dims[1]),
    y = runif(num_features, 0, state_dims[2])
  )
  
  # Calculate radius based on average spacing to ensure overlap
  avg_spacing <- sqrt(prod(state_dims) / num_features)
  radius <- overlap_factor * avg_spacing / 2
  
  # Function to compute the binary feature vector for a given state
  compute_features <- function(state) {
    state_vec <- as.numeric(state)
    distances <- sqrt((centers$x - state_vec[1])^2 + (centers$y - state_vec[2])^2)
    features <- as.numeric(distances <= radius)
    return(features)
  }
  
  return(list(
    compute_features = compute_features,
    centers = centers,
    radius = radius,
    state_dims = state_dims
  ))
}

# --- Visualization Function for Coarse Coding ---
visualize_coarse_coding <- function(coarse_coder, state = NULL) {
  active_features <- if (!is.null(state)) coarse_coder$compute_features(state) else NULL
  active_indices <- if (!is.null(active_features)) which(active_features == 1) else integer(0)
  
  p <- ggplot() +
    # Draw all receptive fields (inactive)
    geom_circle(
      data = coarse_coder$centers,
      aes(x0 = x, y0 = y, r = coarse_coder$radius),
      color = "grey70", fill = NA, linetype = "dashed"
    ) +
    # Highlight active receptive fields
    geom_circle(
      data = coarse_coder$centers[active_indices, ],
      aes(x0 = x, y0 = y, r = coarse_coder$radius),
      color = "#e41a1c", fill = "#e41a1c", alpha = 0.2, size = 1
    ) +
    # Add center points
    geom_point(data = coarse_coder$centers, aes(x = x, y = y), color = "grey50", size = 1)
  
  # Add the query state point
  if (!is.null(state)) {

      x = "State Dimension 1",
      y = "State Dimension 2"
    ) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
}

visualize_coarse_coding(coarse_coder_2d, state = c(3.2, 7.8))
```

### Tile Coding

**Tile coding**, also known as CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller), improves upon coarse coding by providing more structured and uniform coverage. It partitions the state space using multiple overlapping grids, called **tilings**. Each tiling is offset from the others. For any given state, exactly one tile in each tiling will be active. This ensures a constant number of active features, which is computationally efficient.

The offsets provide fine-grained discrimination, while the tile size controls generalization. Unlike coarse coding with circular fields, tile coding's rectangular tiles create **asymmetric generalization** that aligns with the coordinate axes, which is often desirable in control problems where dimensions represent different physical properties (e.g., position and velocity).

```r
# --- Tile Coding Implementation ---
create_tile_coder <- function(state_low, state_high, num_tilings, tiles_per_dim) {
  state_dims <- length(state_low)
  state_range <- state_high - state_low
  tile_widths <- state_range / tiles_per_dim
  
  # Generate offsets for each tiling
  offsets <- sapply(1:state_dims, function(i) {
    (1:num_tilings - 1) * tile_widths[i] / num_tilings
  })
  
  # Function to get the indices of active tiles for a given state
  get_active_tiles <- function(state) {
    active_tiles <- list()
    for (t in 1:num_tilings) {
      tile_indices <- floor((state - state_low + offsets[t, ]) / tile_widths)
      active_tiles[[t]] <- tile_indices
    }
    return(active_tiles)
  }
  
  return(list(
    get_active_tiles = get_active_tiles,
    state_low = state_low,
    state_high = state_high,
    num_tilings = num_tilings,
    tiles_per_dim = tiles_per_dim,
    tile_widths = tile_widths,
    offsets = offsets
  ))
}

  if (length(tile_coder$state_low) != 2) stop("Visualization is for 2D state spaces only.")

### Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)

**Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)** are smooth, continuous basis functions that produce a graded response based on the distance to a center point. The most common form is the Gaussian RBF:

$$\phi_i(s) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|s - c_i\|^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right)$$

Here, $c\_i$ is the center of the $i$-th RBF and $\\sigma\_i$ is its width (or bandwidth). Unlike binary features, RBFs provide a continuous measure of similarity. The width $\\sigma$ controls the locality of influence: a small $\\sigma$ creates a "spiky" function with local generalization, while a large $\\sigma$ creates a smooth function with broad generalization.

RBF networks are **universal approximators**, meaning they can represent any continuous function with arbitrary accuracy, given enough basis functions. The placement of centers and choice of widths are critical. Centers can be placed on a fixed grid, randomly, or adapted during learning using techniques like k-means clustering on experienced states.

```r
# --- Radial Basis Function (RBF) Implementation ---
create_rbf_network <- function(centers, sigmas) {
  if (is.vector(sigmas)) {
    sigmas <- rep(sigmas[1], nrow(centers))
  }
  
  compute_features <- function(state) {
    state_vec <- as.numeric(state)
    distances_sq <- colSums((t(centers) - state_vec)^2)
    features <- exp(-distances_sq / (2 * sigmas^2))
    return(features)
  }
  
  return(list(
    compute_features = compute_features,
    centers = centers,
    sigmas = sigmas
  ))
}

# --- Visualization Function for RBF Network Activation ---
visualize_rbf_activation <- function(rbf_network, state_dims) {
  # Create a grid of points to evaluate the RBF network
  grid_df <- expand.grid(
    x = seq(0, state_dims[1], length.out = 100),
    y = seq(0, state_dims[2], length.out = 100)

The choice of basis function depends on the problem, computational budget, and desired generalization properties.

  * **Computational Efficiency**: **Tile coding** is often the fastest, as it involves simple arithmetic and guarantees a fixed, small number of active features. Coarse coding can be slower if it requires checking against many overlapping regions. RBFs are typically the most expensive, as they require distance calculations to all centers.
  * **Memory Requirements**: A tile coder with $N$ tilings and $T$ tiles per tiling has $N \\times T$ features. RBFs require storing all centers and widths. The memory footprint depends on the number of basis functions needed for the desired accuracy.
  * **Generalization Control**: **RBFs** offer the most fine-grained control over generalization through the placement of centers and tuning of widths. **Tile coding** provides structured, axis-aligned generalization controlled by the number and shape of tiles. **Coarse coding** is the most straightforward but offers the least precise control.
  * **Ease of Use**: Tile coding is often a strong default choice for low-to-medium dimensional control problems due to its computational efficiency and robust performance with minimal tuning.

Linear function approximation and classical basis functions are not merely historical footnotes; they are the conceptual foundation upon which deep RL is built. They provide a clear and analyzable framework for understanding the core challenge of RL: balancing discrimination and generalization. The principles of feature design, the mathematics of TD updates, and the properties of different basis functions offer crucial insights that remain relevant when designing, training, and debugging complex neural network architectures.

Mastering these fundamentals provides the intuition needed to navigate the complexities of modern RL. The journey from tabular methods to deep learning necessarily passes through this foundational territory, making it essential knowledge for any serious RL practitioner.
