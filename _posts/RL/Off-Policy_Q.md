# On-Policy vs Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning: SARSA, Q-Learning, and Monte Carlo in R

## Introduction

In model-free reinforcement learning (RL), agents learn optimal policies directly from experience without a model of the environment’s dynamics. Two key approaches are on-policy and off-policy methods, exemplified by SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) and Q-Learning, respectively. Additionally, off-policy Monte Carlo methods leverage importance sampling to learn optimal policies from exploratory data. This post explores these methods, focusing on their theoretical foundations, practical implications, and implementation in R. We use a 10-state, 2-action environment to compare how SARSA, Q-Learning, and off-policy Monte Carlo learn policies and adapt to environmental changes, such as outcome devaluation. Mathematical formulations and R code are provided to illustrate the concepts.

## Theoretical Background

Both SARSA, Q-Learning, and off-policy Monte Carlo aim to estimate the action-value function $Q^\pi(s,a)$, the expected discounted return for taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following policy $\pi$:

$$
Q^\pi(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_{t+1} \mid S_0 = s, A_0 = a \right]
$$

where $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is the discount factor, and $R_{t+1}$ is the reward at time $t+1$.

### SARSA (On-Policy)

SARSA is an on-policy method, meaning it learns the value of the policy being followed, including exploration. The update rule is:

$$
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s,a) \right)
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $r$ is the reward, $s'$ is the next state, and $a'$ is the action actually taken in $s'$ according to the current policy (e.g., $\epsilon$-greedy). SARSA updates $Q$ based on the next state-action pair $(s', a')$, making it sensitive to the exploration policy. In the 10-state environment, SARSA learns a policy that accounts for exploratory actions, potentially avoiding risky moves that lead to lower rewards.

### Q-Learning (Off-Policy)

Q-Learning is an off-policy method, meaning it learns the optimal policy $\pi^*$ regardless of the exploration policy (e.g., $\epsilon$-greedy). The update rule is:

$$
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s,a) \right)
$$

where $\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ estimates the value of the next state assuming the optimal action. This bootstrapping makes Q-Learning converge to the optimal action-value function $Q^*(s,a)$. In the 10-state environment, Q-Learning favors actions that maximize future rewards (e.g., action 1 in state 9, yielding a 1.0 reward at the terminal state), ignoring exploration effects.

### Off-Policy Monte Carlo with Importance Sampling

Off-policy Monte Carlo uses importance sampling to learn the value of a target policy (e.g., greedy) from episodes generated by a behavior policy (e.g., random). The return $G_t$ (cumulative discounted reward from time $t$ onward) is weighted by the importance sampling ratio:

$$
\rho_t = \prod_{k=t}^T \frac{\pi(a_k|s_k)}{\mu(a_k|s_k)}
$$

where $\pi$ is the target policy, $\mu$ is the behavior policy, and $T$ is the episode length. The Q-value update is:

$$
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left( \rho_t G_t - Q(s,a) \right)
$$

**Importance Sampling Mechanics**: In the 10-state environment, suppose the behavior policy is random (0.5 probability for actions 1 and 2), but the target policy is greedy (choosing the action with the highest Q-value). If the agent in state 9 takes action 2 (reward 0.5 at the terminal state), but the greedy policy prefers action 1 (reward 1.0), the importance sampling ratio $\rho_t$ is low (e.g., 0 if the greedy policy assigns zero probability to action 2), reducing the update’s impact. This allows learning the optimal policy from exploratory trajectories, but high variance can occur if the policies diverge significantly. Weighted importance sampling (as in the code below) normalizes weights to reduce variance, and early termination (stopping when $\rho_t = 0$) improves efficiency.

## Step 1: Environment Setup in R

We use a 10-state, 2-action environment with stochastic transitions and rewards. The terminal state (state 10) yields higher rewards for action 1 (1.0) than action 2 (0.5).

```r
# Common settings
n_states <- 10
n_actions <- 2
gamma <- 0.9
terminal_state <- n_states

# Environment: transition and reward models
set.seed(42)
transition_model <- array(0, dim = c(n_states, n_actions, n_states))
reward_model <- array(0, dim = c(n_states, n_actions, n_states))

for (s in 1:(n_states - 1)) {
  transition_model[s, 1, s + 1] <- 0.9
  transition_model[s, 1, sample(1:n_states, 1)] <- 0.1
  transition_model[s, 2, sample(1:n_states, 1)] <- 0.8
  transition_model[s, 2, sample(1:n_states, 1)] <- 0.2
  for (s_prime in 1:n_states) {
    reward_model[s, 1, s_prime] <- ifelse(s_prime == n_states, 1.0, 0.1 * runif(1))
    reward_model[s, 2, s_prime] <- ifelse(s_prime == n_states, 0.5, 0.05 * runif(1))
  }
}

transition_model[n_states, , ] <- 0
reward_model[n_states, , ] <- 0

# Sampling function
sample_env <- function(s, a) {
  probs <- transition_model[s, a, ]
  s_prime <- sample(1:n_states, 1, prob = probs)
  reward <- reward_model[s, a, s_prime]
  list(s_prime = s_prime, reward = reward)
}
```

## Step 2: Q-Learning Implementation in R

Q-Learning uses the off-policy update rule, selecting actions via an $\epsilon$-greedy policy.

```r
q_learning <- function(episodes = 1000, alpha = 0.1, epsilon = 0.1) {
  Q <- matrix(0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_actions)
  
  for (ep in 1:episodes) {
    s <- 1
    while (TRUE) {
      a <- if (runif(1) < epsilon) sample(1:n_actions, 1) else which.max(Q[s, ])
      out <- sample_env(s, a)
      s_prime <- out$s_prime
      reward <- out$reward
      
      Q[s, a] <- Q[s, a] + alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q[s_prime, ]) - Q[s, a])
      
      if (s_prime == n_states) break
      s <- s_prime
    }
  }
  list(Q = Q, policy = apply(Q, 1, which.max))
}
```

## Step 3: SARSA Implementation in R

SARSA follows the on-policy update rule, selecting the next action $a'$ based on the current policy before updating $Q$.

```r
sarsa <- function(episodes = 1000, alpha = 0.1, epsilon = 0.1) {
  Q <- matrix(0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_actions)
  
  for (ep in 1:episodes) {
    s <- 1
    a <- if (runif(1) < epsilon) sample(1:n_actions, 1) else which.max(Q[s, ])
    while (TRUE) {
      out <- sample_env(s, a)
      s_prime <- out$s_prime
      reward <- out$reward
      
      # Select next action a' using the current policy
      a_prime <- if (runif(1) < epsilon) sample(1:n_actions, 1) else which.max(Q[s_prime, ])
      
      # SARSA update
      Q[s, a] <- Q[s, a] + alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[s_prime, a_prime] - Q[s, a])
      
      if (s_prime == n_states) break
      s <- s_prime
      a <- a_prime
    }
  }
  list(Q = Q, policy = apply(Q, 1, which.max))
}
```

## Step 4: Off-Policy Monte Carlo Implementation in R

Off-policy Monte Carlo uses a random behavior policy and importance sampling to learn the greedy target policy.

```r
off_policy_monte_carlo <- function(episodes = 1000, alpha = 0.1, epsilon = 0.1) {
  Q <- matrix(0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_actions)
  C <- matrix(0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_actions)  # Cumulative importance weights
  
  for (ep in 1:episodes) {
    episode <- list()
    s <- 1
    # Use random behavior policy (uniform over actions)
    while (TRUE) {
      a <- sample(1:n_actions, 1)
      out <- sample_env(s, a)
      episode[[length(episode) + 1]] <- list(state = s, action = a, reward = out$reward)
      if (out$s_prime == n_states) break
      s <- out$s_prime
    }
    
    G <- 0
    W <- 1  # Importance sampling ratio
    for (t in length(episode):1) {
      s <- episode[[t]]$state
      a <- episode[[t]]$action
      r <- episode[[t]]$reward
      G <- gamma * G + r
      
      # Update only if the action matches the greedy target policy
      greedy_a <- which.max(Q[s, ])
      if (a == greedy_a) {
        C[s, a] <- C[s, a] + W
        Q[s, a] <- Q[s, a] + (W / C[s, a]) * (G - Q[s, a])
      }
      
      # Update importance sampling ratio (behavior: uniform, target: greedy)
      W <- W * (ifelse(a == greedy_a, 1 / epsilon, 0) / (1 / n_actions))
      if (W == 0) break  # Early termination if ratio becomes zero
    }
  }
  list(Q = Q, policy = apply(Q, 1, which.max))
}
```

## Step 5: Outcome Devaluation

We simulate a change in the environment by setting terminal state rewards to 0 and observe how policies behave without retraining.

```r
# Run algorithms before devaluation
sarsa_result_before <- sarsa()
ql_result_before <- q_learning()
mc_result_before <- off_policy_monte_carlo()

# Devalue terminal reward
for (s in 1:(n_states - 1)) {
  reward_model[s, 1, n_states] <- 0
  reward_model[s, 2, n_states] <- 0
}

# Policies after devaluation (no retraining)
sarsa_policy_after <- sarsa_result_before$policy
ql_policy_after <- ql_result_before$policy
mc_policy_after <- mc_result_before$policy
```

## Step 6: Visualizing Policies

We plot the policies before and after devaluation to compare SARSA, Q-Learning, and off-policy Monte Carlo.

```r
plot_policy <- function(policy, label, col = "skyblue") {
  barplot(policy, names.arg = 1:n_states, col = col,
          ylim = c(0, 3), ylab = "Action (1=A1, 2=A2)",
          main = label)
  abline(h = 1.5, lty = 2, col = "gray")
}

par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot_policy(sarsa_result_before$policy, "SARSA Policy Before", "skyblue")
plot_policy(sarsa_policy_after, "SARSA Policy After", "lightgreen")
plot_policy(ql_result_before$policy, "Q-Learning Policy Before", "orange")
plot_policy(ql_policy_after, "Q-Learning Policy After", "lightcoral")
plot_policy(mc_result_before$policy, "Off-Policy MC Policy Before", "purple")
plot_policy(mc_policy_after, "Off-Policy MC Policy After", "orchid")
```

## Interpretation and Discussion

### Policy Differences
- **SARSA**: As an on-policy method, it learns the value of the $\epsilon$-greedy policy, which includes exploratory actions. In the 10-state environment, SARSA may balance between actions 1 and 2, reflecting the impact of random exploration, leading to a more conservative policy.
- **Q-Learning**: As an off-policy method, it learns the optimal policy, favoring action 1 in state 9 (higher terminal reward of 1.0) due to its greedy updates. Its policy is less sensitive to exploration noise, as it assumes optimal future actions.
- **Off-Policy Monte Carlo**: Also off-policy, it learns the optimal policy using importance sampling to reweight returns from a random behavior policy. It may align closely with Q-Learning’s policy but can exhibit variability due to high variance in importance sampling ratios, especially if the random policy frequently selects action 2 (lower reward).

### Devaluation
All methods exhibit habitual behavior without retraining, retaining their original policies after the terminal reward is removed. This highlights a limitation of model-free methods compared to model-based approaches (e.g., dynamic programming), which adapt instantly to reward changes.

### Practical Implications
- **SARSA**: Better suited for environments where the exploration policy must be accounted for, such as safety-critical systems (e.g., robotics), where risky exploratory actions could lead to poor outcomes.
- **Q-Learning**: Ideal for scenarios where the optimal policy is desired regardless of exploration, such as games or simulations where exploration does not incur real-world costs.
- **Off-Policy Monte Carlo**: Suitable for offline learning from logged data (e.g., recommendation systems), but high variance can make it less stable than Q-Learning in dynamic environments.

### Experimental Observations
- Before devaluation, Q-Learning and off-policy Monte Carlo likely favor action 1 in state 9 due to its higher terminal reward, while SARSA’s policy may show more variability due to exploration. 
- After devaluation, all policies remain unchanged without retraining, illustrating their reliance on cached Q-values.
- Off-policy Monte Carlo’s performance depends on the similarity between the random behavior policy and the greedy target policy, with high variance potentially leading to less consistent policies compared to Q-Learning.

## Conclusion

SARSA, Q-Learning, and off-policy Monte Carlo represent distinct paradigms in model-free RL. SARSA’s on-policy updates reflect the exploration policy, making it conservative. Q-Learning’s off-policy updates target the optimal policy, ignoring exploration effects. Off-policy Monte Carlo uses importance sampling to learn from diverse trajectories, enabling offline learning but introducing variance. The R implementations demonstrate these differences in a 10-state environment, and the devaluation experiment underscores their habitual nature. Future posts could explore advanced topics, such as SARSA($\lambda$), deep RL extensions, or variance reduction in off-policy Monte Carlo.
