### Federated inference and learning



In a revious post we have mentioned that free energy minimization extends beyond isolated agents. In federated systems, groups collectively reduce free energy through belief-sharing protocols that harmonize local inferences into global consensus. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a unifying account of self-organization across scales. Biological systems like fish schools exemplify this: individuals minimize surprise about their neighbors’ movements while collectively exhibiting complex patterns like milling or directed migration. These behaviors emerge not from explicit coordination rules but from each agent’s Bayesian belief updating under a shared generative model. **Federated inference** represent an approach to distributed cognition, enabling agents to collaboratively enhance their understanding of a shared world. Within the frameworks of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, federated inference and learning emerge as natural consequences of agents striving to minimize surprise and maximize model evidence. This essay explores the principles and mechanisms underlying federated inference and learning, emphasizing the roles of shared generative models, belief sharing, active learning, and the emergence of complexity in multi-agent systems.

At its core, federated inference relies on the concept that multiple agents, each with their own perspective and sensory experiences, can collectively infer the hidden states of a shared environment more effectively than any single agent acting alone. This is achieved through the **sharing of posterior beliefs**, which allows agents to integrate information from diverse sources and refine their internal models of the world. In a federated setting, agents not only minimize their individual free energy but also contribute to the minimization of a **joint free energy** at the group level. This requires agents to share their beliefs and coordinate their actions in a way that maximizes the overall coherence and predictability of the system. The sharing of beliefs can be understood as a form of communication, where agents broadcast their internal states to other members of the group.





**A shared generative model** is crucial for enabling effective communication and belief sharing among agents. The generative model encodes an agent's beliefs about the causal structure of the world, including the relationships between hidden states, observations, and actions. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation.m**Belief sharing** is fundamental to realizing joint free energy minimization, distributed over ensembles of free energy minimizing processes and over the timescales at which these processes unfold. Belief sharing is most effective when agents communicate full belief distributions rather than limiting belief-sharing to a noisy gradient estimate.

As agents engage in federated inference and learning, they not only improve their individual performance but also contribute to the emergence of **collective intelligence** at the group level. Collective intelligence refers to the ability of a group to solve complex problems and make decisions that exceed the capabilities of any single member. Within the active inference framework, collective intelligence emerges from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. As free energy is minimized, **complexity** emerges within the collective. Increased accuracy in understanding the environment leads to increased complexity, reflecting the collective's ability to represent and process information about its surroundings. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment. Active learning and selection complement each other. In active learning, posterior parameters change to minimize variational free energy if, and only if, expected free energy is reduced. Conversely, in active selection, prior parameters change to minimize expected free energy if, and only if, variational free energy is reduced as scored with Bayesian model reduction. The implicit bootstrapping underwrites self-evidencing towards precise and predictable exchanges.

One of the essential aspects of federated inference is its role in collective behavior. Heins et al. (2023) explore how surprise minimization governs interactions within social systems, demonstrating that agents engaged in active inference adjust their expectations and responses to align with a broader collective. This process is crucial for large-scale coordination, from ant colonies to human societies, where individuals must reconcile their local predictions with the global network’s evolving structure. The interplay between cognition and collective intelligence has been extensively studied in the context of federated inference. Kaufmann et al. (2021) use active inference to model how cognitive processes interact with distributed intelligence networks, demonstrating that federated belief updating enhances the efficiency and adaptability of multi-agent systems. Their findings suggest that decentralized networks—whether composed of human participants, artificial agents, or hybrid collectives—exhibit superior problem-solving capabilities when they can share and integrate beliefs effectively.



Federated architectures implement collective active inference through three core mechanisms: belief-sharing protocols, adaptive learning dynamics, and hierarchical prediction-error minimization. Belief-sharing requires agents to encode posterior beliefs into transmissible signals—a process formalized as likelihood mappings from internal states to observable messages. In federated learning, this corresponds to clients transmitting model updates to a server, which aggregates them into a global belief state. Crucially, message precision (inverse variance) determines their influence during aggregation, mirroring neurobiological mechanisms where prediction errors are weighted by their reliability.  

Hierarchical prediction-error minimization enables federated systems to operate across temporal and spatial scales. At the micro scale, individual agents resolve sensory prediction errors through local belief updates. At the macro scale, the collective minimizes global free energy by redistributing computational loads—as seen in federated networks that shift training tasks from energy-constrained devices to more capable neighbors. This multi-scale optimization emerges naturally from active inference principles, where agents prioritize policies (action sequences) that minimize expected free energy over both immediate and long-term horizons.

Biological collectives provide examples of federated active inference. Fish schools achieve predator detection through distributed belief-sharing: each individual’s visual inferences about potential threats are integrated into a global vigilance state without centralized processing. Simulation studies demonstrate that these systems spontaneously develop hierarchical communication protocols—analogous to federated averaging in machine learning where localized motion cues aggregate into group-level directional consensus. In technological domains, federated active inference enables energy-efficient IoT networks. A 2022 study optimized smartphone-based federated learning by co-running training processes with foreground applications, exploiting underutilized computational cycles to reduce energy consumption by 63%. This approach treats energy expenditure as a form of thermodynamic free energy, applying the FEP to balance model accuracy against battery constraints. Adaptive agents dynamically adjusted batch sizes from 256 to 512 samples based on power availability, demonstrating how free energy minimization generalizes beyond cognitive tasks to resource management.  Scientific communities themselves operate as federated inference systems. Researchers act as Bayesian agents updating hypotheses (beliefs) through peer-reviewed publications (belief-sharing), with the collective goal of minimizing disciplinary prediction error. The replication crisis exemplifies a breakdown in this process, where insufficient error correction allowed high-free-energy models to persist—a scenario analogous to federated systems failing to detect Byzantine clients. Remedies inspired by active inference include preprint servers that accelerate belief propagation and meta-analytic frameworks that weight studies by their predictive precision.  

An interesting frontier to progress involves formalizing the "economics" of belief propagation. Agents in open federated systems may manipulate shared beliefs for self-interest—a phenomenon observed in blockchain networks plagued by dishonest nodes. Integrating game-theoretic concepts with active inference could yield mechanisms for detecting and excluding adversarial agents while preserving decentralization. Preliminary work shows promise: by treating trust as a precision parameter in Bayesian belief updates, systems automatically downweight contributions from unreliable participants. Future research must also bridge the gap between biological and artificial federated systems. While machine learning focuses on parameter transmission, biological collectives like ant colonies exchange chemical signals encoding complex priors about resource locations. Developing bio-inspired federated protocols that transmit compressed generative models—rather than raw parameters—could dramatically improve communication efficiency.
