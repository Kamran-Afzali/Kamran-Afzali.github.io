Quantile regression is a regression method for estimating these conditional quantile functions. Just as linear regression estimates the conditional mean function as a linear combination of the predictors, quantile regression estimates the conditional quantile function as a linear combination of the predictors.

R is a open source software project and can be freely downloaded from the CRAN website along with its associated documentation. For unix-based operating systems it is usual to download and build R from source, but binary versions are available for most computing platforms and can be easily installed. Once R is running the installation of additional packages is quite straightward. To install the quantile regression package from R one simply types, 

nstall.packages("quantreg") Provided that your machine has a proper internet connection and you have write permission in the appropriate system directories, the installation of the package should proceed automatically. Once the quantreg package is installed, it needs to be made accessible to the current R session by the command,
