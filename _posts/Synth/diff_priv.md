Differential privacy is a mathematical framework and set of techniques for ensuring the privacy of individuals in datasets while still allowing for useful analysis of the data.

The core idea is to introduce controlled noise or randomness into the data or analysis in a way that masks the presence or absence of any individual's data, while still preserving the overall statistical properties and insights that can be derived from the dataset as a whole.

More specifically, differential privacy provides a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy loss and a strong guarantee: for any individual in the dataset, the probability of any output (e.g. statistics, machine learning model) being produced is essentially the same whether that individual's data is included or not. This is achieved by carefully calibrating the amount of random noise added based on the sensitivity of the computation being performed.[2]

Some key properties of differential privacy that make it valuable:

- It provides quantifiable privacy loss parameters (epsilon) that allow trading off privacy vs. accuracy/utility.[4]
- The privacy guarantee is robust to auxiliary information an attacker may have, protecting against re-identification attacks.[3]
- Privacy loss compounds gracefully over multiple analyses via composition properties.[4]
- It allows for rigorous analysis of privacy loss for groups (not just individuals).[4]
- The guarantee is preserved even after post-processing the output.[2]

Differential privacy has been widely adopted in industry and government for enabling privacy-preserving data analysis, sharing, and machine learning on sensitive datasets containing personal information.[3][5] Key applications include data publishing, private AI/ML, private analytics, and more.

There are two main types of differential privacy:

1. Global Differential Privacy (GDP)
Global differential privacy applies noise to the output of an algorithm that operates on an entire dataset. The noise is calibrated to mask the influence of any single data point on the output, providing a strong privacy guarantee for all individuals in the dataset.[1]

2. Local Differential Privacy (LDP)  
Local differential privacy applies noise to each individual data point before it is collected or sent to an algorithm. The randomized response technique is a classic example, where each user randomizes their data locally before sending it, ensuring their privacy is protected without trusting the data collector.[1][4]

The key difference is where the noise is introduced - globally on the output in GDP, versus locally on each data point in LDP. GDP requires a trusted data curator, while LDP allows untrusted data collection by design.

Some other variants of differential privacy include:

- (ε, δ)-Differential Privacy: A relaxed version that allows a small probability δ of not providing the strict ε-differential privacy guarantee.[4]

- Concentrated Differential Privacy: Provides tighter bounds on privacy loss for composition of many DP operations.[4] 

- Renyi Differential Privacy: An extension using Renyi divergence instead of log likelihood ratios.[4]

- Gaussian Differential Privacy: Using Gaussian noise instead of Laplacian noise.[4]

- Zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy: Provides optimal privacy amplification by subsampling.[4]

So in summary, global vs local DP are the two main categories, with various extensions proposed to improve utility or provide tighter analysis in different settings.[1][4]

Here are some examples of how differential privacy can be applied in the context of health data:

Sharing Aggregate Statistics
Healthcare organizations can use differential privacy to share aggregate statistics about patients, such as the prevalence of certain diseases or average treatment costs, without revealing personal information about individual patients.[1][3] The noise added through differential privacy masks the contribution of any single patient record.

Disease Surveillance 
Public health agencies can leverage differential privacy to study the spread of infectious diseases like influenza or COVID-19 based on patient data, while protecting patient privacy.[1] The University of California, Berkeley has used this approach for disease surveillance.[1]

Healthcare Utilization Analysis
Differential privacy enables analysis of healthcare utilization patterns and costs across populations, without compromising individual patient confidentiality.[1] The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) has applied this technique.[1]  

 Medical Research
Researchers can perform analyses on sensitive medical datasets, such as electronic health records or genomic data, using differential privacy to protect patient privacy while still enabling valuable insights.[3][4] The added noise prevents re-identification attacks.

 Data Collection from Wearables
Companies like Apple use differential privacy to collect data from users' devices and apps about usage patterns, health metrics, etc. while ensuring the raw individual data remains private.[4] Only the noisy aggregates are used for product improvements.

 Synthetic Data Generation
Differential privacy can support generating high-quality synthetic datasets that mimic real health data for research, testing or training purposes, without exposing actual patient information.[1][3]

The key benefit of differential privacy in healthcare is enabling insights from data while providing a rigorous, mathematically provable privacy guarantee to protect sensitive patient information, which is critical for maintaining trust and complying with regulations like HIPAA.[2][3]
