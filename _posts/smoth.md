As an alternative, in 2002, Chawla et al. [15] proposed a novel oversampling method, SMOTE, where instead of replicating existing instances, new instances were synthesized to balance the dataset. In SMOTE, for each underrepresented instance, a predetermined number of neighbors were calculated, then some minority class instances were randomly chosen for synthetic data point creation. Finally, artificial observations were created along the line between the selected minority instance and its closest neighbors. Chawla et al. experimented with SMOTE on a wide range of datasets which showed that SMOTE can improve classifier performance for minority class. By virtue of being trained on more underrepresented examples, SMOTE decreased generalization errors.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a technique used for generating synthetic data in order to address the problem of class imbalance in machine learning. It is a type of data augmentation for the minority class and is used to oversample the minority class by creating synthetic examples[1][3]. SMOTE works by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space, and drawing a new sample at a point along that line. Specifically, a random example from the minority class is first chosen. Then k of the nearest neighbors for that example are found (typically k=5). A randomly selected neighbor is chosen and a synthetic example is created at a randomly selected point between the two examples in feature space[1].

SMOTE can be used to generate synthetic data for imbalanced datasets in order to improve the performance of machine learning models. It can be used in combination with other techniques such as undersampling, or with other variants of SMOTE such as Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN[1][3]. SMOTE can be implemented using various libraries in Python such as imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn[1][5].

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is an oversampling method used to balance class distribution in datasets[4]. It is a machine learning technique that solves problems that occur when using an imbalanced dataset[2]. SMOTE works by creating synthetic examples for the minority class. It selects the minority examples that are close to the feature space and draws a line between the examples in the feature space. Then, it draws a new sample at a point along that line[4]. The algorithm selects a random example from the minority class and selects a random neighbor using K Nearest Neighbors. The synthetic example is created between two examples in the feature space[4][1]. Specifically, a random example from the minority class is first chosen. Then k of the nearest neighbors for that example are found (typically k=5). A randomly selected neighbor is chosen and a synthetic example is created at a randomly selected point between the two examples in feature space[1]. 

There are some variations of SMOTE, such as ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method), which is a modification of SMOTE that generates more synthetic examples near the boundary of the minority class[1]. 

SMOTE is a powerful solution for imbalanced data, but it has a drawback. It does not consider the majority class while creating synthetic examples, which can cause issues where there is a strong overlap between the classes[4]. Therefore, the original SMOTE paper suggests combining oversampling (SMOTE) with the undersampling of the majority class, as SMOTE does not consider the majority class while creating new samples[4]. 

In summary, SMOTE is a technique used to balance class distribution in datasets. It creates synthetic examples for the minority class by selecting the minority examples that are close to the feature space and drawing a new sample at a point along that line. There are some variations of SMOTE, such as ADASYN, which generates more synthetic examples near the boundary of the minority class. However, SMOTE does not consider the majority class while creating synthetic examples, which can cause issues where there is a strong overlap between the classes. Therefore, it is suggested to combine oversampling (SMOTE) with the undersampling of the majority class to achieve better results.


Here's a pseudocode for the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) algorithm:

```
function SMOTE(dataset, minority_class, N, k):
    synthetic_samples = []

    for each sample in minority_class:
        neighbors = k_nearest_neighbors(sample, dataset, k)
        
        for i in range(N):
            neighbor = randomly_select_neighbor(neighbors)
            synthetic_sample = generate_synthetic_sample(sample, neighbor)
            synthetic_samples.append(synthetic_sample)

    return synthetic_samples

function k_nearest_neighbors(sample, dataset, k):
    distances = compute_distances(sample, dataset)
    sorted_neighbors = sort_by_distance(distances)
    return sorted_neighbors[:k]

function randomly_select_neighbor(neighbors):
    return randomly_pick_one_neighbor(neighbors)

function generate_synthetic_sample(sample, neighbor):
    synthetic_sample = {}
    
    for each feature in sample:
        difference = neighbor[feature] - sample[feature]
        synthetic_sample[feature] = sample[feature] + random_uniform(0, 1) * difference

    return synthetic_sample
```

In this pseudocode:
- `dataset` is the entire dataset.
- `minority_class` is the class that is in the minority (you apply SMOTE to balance it with the majority class).
- `N` is the number of synthetic samples to generate for each original minority class sample.
- `k` is the number of nearest neighbors to consider when generating synthetic samples.

The basic steps of SMOTE involve selecting a sample from the minority class, finding its k-nearest neighbors, and creating synthetic samples by combining features from the selected sample and its neighbors.

Keep in mind that this pseudocode provides a conceptual understanding of how SMOTE works. Depending on the specific implementation or programming language you're using, the actual code may vary in terms of details and optimizations.
