Theories of consciousness are diverse and aim to address different aspects of the phenomenon. Some theories attempt to tackle the "hard problem" of consciousness, which is the question of why and how brain functions are accompanied by conscious experience. Other theories focus on modeling how specific types of experiential content are implemented by neural structures and dynamics. The targets of these theories also vary. They range from explaining the basic awareness common to all conscious beings to the more complex consciousness found in humans, which includes higher-order cognitive processes like interoception, selfhood, first-person perspective, and theory of mind. Recent trends in consciousness studies advocate for a move towards "neatness" and theoretical unification. The concept of "minimal unifying models" (MUMs) of consciousness has been proposed, which are models that specify only the necessary properties of conscious experience, provide well-defined descriptions that can be further analyzed and extended, and integrate existing theories by highlighting their common assumptions. The "inner screen model" of consciousness, derived from the Free Energy Principle (FEP), is being assessed as a potential MUM. This model is based on the idea that consciousness can be understood as a form of internal representation or "screen" within the brain, which is influenced by and interacts with various neural processes. The FEP-based approaches to consciousness each focus on mapping specific aspects or processes of consciousness. The goal is to show how these models, premised on the FEP, can be integrated in a meaningful way to provide a solid foundation for the study of consciousness.







Here we discuss the Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been applied to the hard problem of consciousness, with affect identified as its elemental form and its physiological mechanism located in the upper brainstem. This principle has been used to define neural correlates of consciousness in terms of neural dynamics and computational correlates, which has implications for understanding consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behavior. The exploration of consciousness, from both philosophical and neuroscientific perspectives, reveals a multifaceted problem that requires further understanding. Consciousness emerges not merely as a byproduct of neurophysiological activities but as a profound interplay between mind and body. Memory, as both a psychological and physiological process, underscores the interconnectedness between mental and physical phenomena. Affective states form the basis of consciousness, with emotional learning supplementing innate predictions and shaping conscious experiences. This integration of affective and cognitive consciousness underscores the fundamental role of emotions in guiding adaptive behavior and learning, providing a nuanced understanding of the subjective nature of consciousness. The Free Energy Principle offers a theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of consciousness rooted in neurophysiological dynamics. Markov blankets establish boundary conditions, separating self-organizing systems from the external environment and giving rise to subjective observational perspectives. Consciousness, as a mechanism for monitoring internal states in relation to external forces, is inherently tied to affective processes that guide adaptive behavior. This integration of affective and cognitive consciousness provides insights into the fundamental nature of subjective experience, bridging the gap between philosophical inquiry and empirical findings in neuroscience. Ultimately, the exploration of consciousness invites a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between mind and body, shedding light on one of the most enduring mysteries of human existence.






**Bayesian global workspace** theories are a set of theories that reframe global workspace theory through a Bayesian lens. They explore how information is processed and integrated in the brain, particularly focusing on attentional processes and their connection to consciousness. These theories suggest that consciousness arises from the availability of information within a "global workspace" in the brain, where various brain networks can share information, leading to coherent activity and the integration of information across different brain regions and modalities. Global workspace theory proposes that consciousness is associated with the ability of the brain to broadcast information within this global workspace. It suggests that consciousness emerges from the aggregation of concurrent processes in the brain, allowing for self-organization into larger-scale networks. This framework provides a scientific explanation for how information is projected and integrated in the brain, enabling the formation of integrated representations of the external world. Neuroscientific models based on global workspace theory, such as global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT), propose that consciousness arises from "ignition events" where information is aggregated and broadcast across distributed networks in the brain. Empirical studies using neuroimaging techniques have supported these ideas, showing widespread activation of specific brain regions during conscious perception. Overall, Bayesian global workspace theories offer insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness and its relation to attentional processes. 
 These theories recast the original **global workspace** theory through a Bayesian or free energy principle lens. This includes Bayesian versions of global workspace theory itself, as well as Bayesian versions of the attention schema theory.The original global workspace theory (GWT) was proposed by Baars and Newman in 1994. It was later developed into biologically-grounded models like the global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) by Dehaene, Kerszberg, and Changeux, and the dynamic core hypothesis by Edelman and Tononi. GWT is one of the most popular frameworks in the neuroscience of consciousness.GWT and related models focus on attentional processes and their relation to consciousness. They understand consciousness in terms of the availability and access to information within the brain. This is sometimes characterized as "access consciousness" rather than "phenomenal consciousness", though this distinction is controversial. In the classical GWT, consciousness is associated with the availability of information in a "global workspace" in the brain. This allows different brain networks to broadcast information to each other, enabling the integration of information across modalities. GWT posits a specific scale of brain activity, modeled as a neural network with four recurrently-connected levels, where local processes self-organize into a larger network. The GNWT model further develops this, explaining conscious experience as arising from "ignition events" where information is aggregated and broadcast through the global workspace, potentially involving the inhibition of competing processes. GNWT identifies the prefrontal and parietal regions as the loci of these ignition events, with conscious experience resulting from the late activation of these regions.bEmpirical studies using neuroimaging techniques have supported the predictions of GNWT, showing widespread activation of frontal and parietal regions during conscious perception, in contrast with more limited activation for unconscious stimuli. This large-scale ignition connects higher-order conceptual areas to sensory cortices, making information more broadly available between these systems.





The next set of models includes the **"winning hypothesis"** account of consciousness, which extends to Bayesian global workspace theories. According to the winning hypothesis approach, the framework of active inference provides a mechanism for inhibition events, potentially integrating or even superseding the classical global workspace theory (GWT) model. The winning hypothesis leverages policy selection and meta-cognitive inference to explain how the contents of conscious experience are generated. In predictive coding, the brain evaluates competing hypotheses about the probable causes of its sensory states. Bayesian global workspace theories suggest that conscious experience corresponds to this kind of inference - the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability given the current data and prior beliefs determines the contents of experience. This view considers attention and perception as distinct but related aspects of prediction error minimization. The accuracy and expected precision of perceptual hypotheses form the "statistical dimensions of conscious perception" - accurate hypotheses minimize prediction error parsimoniously, while precise hypotheses can better ignore noise and pick out relevant inputs. Attention plays a dual role in this framework, adjusting precision weightings and biasing competition among hypotheses. However, conscious perception does not necessarily require both accuracy and precision at the cognitive level - a precise but inaccurate hypothesis could still determine conscious experience, and vice versa. Recent extensions of GWT have specifically leveraged the tools of active inference from the winning hypothesis model. Predictive global workspace theory is a Bayesian version of GWT that implements it using predictive coding. It proposes that consciousness arises in the global workspace, which integrates and processes predictions and prediction errors from across the brain, allowing information to be broadcast throughout distributed networks. Predictive global workspace theory suggests consciousness is a function of the brain's ability to reconcile sensory information with the predictions generated by its internal models. The neuronal dynamics underlying this involve forms of inference with sufficient temporal depth to provide context to incoming cues, which can then be coordinated within the global workspace to enable goal-oriented behavior.


**Attention schema theory** proposes that consciousness arises from the brain's ability to create a model or schema of its own attention processes. This allows the brain to understand and predict its own actions and behaviors, as well as those of others. A Bayesian version of this theory also exists. The basic attention schema theory posits that consciousness is a form of subjective awareness that arises from the attention an agent pays to a given stimulus. The "attention schema" is a simplified model the brain uses to represent its attentional processes to itself, and to inform and direct those processes. According to this theory, whenever we claim to be conscious of something, we are actually using higher-order cognitive processes to introspect on this attention schema and report the information it holds. The schema must be sparse in order to provide an efficient means of controlling more complex processes. The deployment of the attention schema is said to result in the "illusion" of phenomenal consciousness. The proponents of attention schema theory suggest the ethereal and fluid nature of conscious experience is illusory, and that parsimonious explanations of these phenomena can support the theory. A Bayesian version of attention schema theory has also been proposed, which incorporates elements of the "multiple drafts" view. This version builds on Bayesian global workspace theories, arguing that the mere fact a hypothesis has the highest posterior probability is not sufficient to account for the contents of conscious perception. Rather, attentional processes must first reduce the space of possible causes of sensations, and then probe these hypotheses. This ties the "fame in the brain" account back to attention schema theory, providing a deflationary theory of consciousness where apparently essential features of phenomenal consciousness are illusions created by reflexive access. However, the core idea of attention schema theory is largely independent of this illusionism debate.



The enigma of **consciousness** is one of the most difficult puzzles in philosophy and neuroscience. While it is undeniable that certain organisms possess subjective experiences, description of how these systems become subjects of experience is a challenge. Why is it that the engagement of our cognitive faculties with sensory information results in vivid experiences such as the color blue or the sound of a musical note? The underlying physical processes that give rise to consciousness remain unclear. How do neurophysiological activities produce the experience of consciousness? Attempts to address this question often conceptualize the brain as a producer or cause of consciousness, but such formulations may further complicate rather than clarify the nature of the problem. The relationship between the brain and the mind is not that of a simplistic causal explanations and presenting consciousness to a byproduct of physiological processes fails to capture its essence.

Instead, viewing the body and mind as two facets of the same underlying reality challenges us to reconsider our ontological assumptions. If both body and mind are manifestations of a deeper reality, what substance underpins their existence? Analogous to the relationship between thunder and lightning, this question leads us to ponder the metaphysical equivalent of "electricity" in the realm of consciousness. Clarifying the ontological status of terms like "physical basis" and "neurobiological processes" requires a nuanced understanding of their underlying meaning. Rather than viewing physiological phenomena as distinct from their mental counterparts, we must recognize their interconnectedness. Memory, for instance, is not a tangible entity but a functional process that manifests both psychologically and physiologically. By abstracting underlying functional laws from observable phenomena, we can bridge the apparent gap between conscious experience and its neural correlates.

In our pursuit of elucidating the mysteries of consciousness, we encounter not only conceptual challenges but also epistemological hurdles. Identifying the fundamental causal processess that govern conscious experience necessitates researching the nature of reality itself and how organisms interact with the _reality_ of their environment.
The journey through the intricacies of consciousness leads us to a fundamental realization: the level of consciousness is tied to **free energy**. Drawing parallels between thermodynamic concepts and neurophysiological processes, we have already claimed the that arousal (yet free energy), is the cornerstone of wakeful interaction with the environment. This latter is underpinned by surprisal and uncertainty. 

Contrary to the view, which posits the cortex as the seat of consciousness, recent evidence suggests that consciousness emanates from subcortical regions. The cortex, rather than generating consciousness, may serve as a facilitator or stabilizer of affective arousal, transforming it into conscious cognition. This reinterpretation aligns with the remarkable plasticity of the cortex and the hierarchical dependency between brainstem arousal and cortical consciousness. Studies of emotional and cognitive reactions in such beings point to the existence of a basic form of consciousness, rooted in subcortical structures. The efficacy of deep brain stimulation in evoking affective responses further highlights the role of upper brainstem and limbic circuits in generating subjective states.In this view, consciousness emerges as fundamentally affective, rooted in the arousal processes of the upper brainstem. This reformulation challenges traditional paradigms and prompts a reevaluation of the functional mechanisms underlying consciousness. 


The question of **why we feel** is central inquiry in contemporary neuroscience. At its core, feeling is understood as the registration of bodily states within a biological scale of values, where pleasurable feelings signal improving chances of survival and reproductive success, while unpleasurable feelings signify deteriorating conditions. Feelings are not localized in the cortex but originate in the brainstem and limbic system, encompassing both autonomic and intrinsic brain states. As mentionedcabove the shift in focus to the brainstem highlights the primal nature of consciousness, serving as a mechanism for organisms to monitor and regulate deviations from homeostatic equilibrium in unpredictable contexts. Feeling, in this context, enables organisms to prioritize actions and make adaptive choices based on the assessment of relative value attached to different alternatives. Pleasure accompanies a return to homeostasis, while unpleasure signifies deviation from it, prompting the organism to take corrective action. Emotional valence, arising from deviations in homeostatic settling points, serve as signals guiding behavior and learning. By prioritizing needs and opportunities, consciousness emerges as a biological imperative, facilitating survival and adaptation in novel environments. Anatomically, the realization of consciousness involves a complex interplay between body-monitoring at lower levels and higher brain regions, culminating in the processing of affective information in the periaqueductal gray. Here, ongoing evaluations of environmental events and internal states inform perception and action selection, integrating external and internal uncertainties to guide behavior. Ultimately, consciousness is quintessentially affective, rooted in the primal imperative of maintaining biological integrity and adapting to the challenges of life. It is through feeling that organisms navigate the uncertainties of existence, ensuring their continued survival and success in the ever-changing landscape of the world.

**Homeostasis**, crucial for the existence and persistence of self-organizing systems like living organisms. Self-organizing systems resist entropy by occupying preferred states, thus maintaining their integrity over time. Three conditions must be met for a system to resist entropy: the presence of a boundary separating internal and external states, a mechanism to register dissipative external forces (sensory states), and a mechanism to counteract these forces (action). The concept of a Markov blanket, which establishes boundary conditions and separates the system from the external environment, is central to this explanation. The sensory and active capacities of the blanket allow the system to vicariously infer external states and act upon them based on sensory impressions. This necessitates the incorporation of a model of the world, which serves as the basis for perception and action. Through ongoing processes of hypothesis testing, the system updates its model, optimizing its predictions and minimizing free energy. In the context of nervous systems, all other bodily systems are considered external, with the nervous system performing meta-homeostatic functions on their behalf. Nervous systems co-evolved with other bodily systems to orchestrate multiple homeostatic demands, thus regulating the organism as a whole. The mechanisms this meta-homeostasis involve both physiological and psychological processes, with abstract concepts like inference, belief, and prediction. This abstract ontology allows for a unified explanation of homeostasis and its role in the function of consciousness, bridging the gap between physiological and psychological phenomena.



 Solms (2013, 2014) and further Friston (2018) claim that the  **The emergence of consciousness** is rooted in the dynamics of free energy minimization and uncertainty. Initially proposed as the basic function of homeostasis, free energy minimization is performed by brainstem nuclei centrally implicated in the generation of consciousness. Fundamental properties of minds, such as selfhood and intentionality, arise from the dynamics of a Markov blanket, which separates the system from the external environment. The imperative for self-organizing systems to monitor their internal states in relation to external forces leads to the emergence of subjective observational perspectives and active forms of subjectivity. The existence of a Markov blanket also addresses the problem of other minds, as internal states can only be registered vicariously via sensory impressions. In other words, **Consciousness emerges as self-organizing systems monitor their internal states** in relation to potentially annihilatory forces, leading to inherently value-laden processes that is predicated upon the imperative of survival. While proto-mental dynamics involve the computation of subjective values at the level of autonomic homeostasis, the transition to conscious, qualitative mental states revolves around increasing complexity. Qualitative fluctuations in affect arise from continuous comparisons between predicted and actual sensory states, signaling changes in uncertainty and expected consequences of action. This process of precision optimization is inherently affective, with affect playing a central role in engaging with the outside world and determining subjective engagement.




The **emergence of conscious self-states** is fundamentally rooted in affective states, serving as an alarm mechanism guiding self-organizing systems through situations that rise the variational FE. While instinctual behaviors provide innate survival tools, they cannot address the complexities of actual environmental niches. Consequently, innate predictions are supplemented through learning from experience, leading to emotional responses when predictions fail to capture all variance. Emotional learning aims to improve predictions. Non-declarative memories, associated with subcortical systems, involve simpler cause-and-effect links and cannot be retrieved as mental images. Declarative memories, processed in cortical systems, readily return long-term memory (LTM) traces to conscious working memory for updating. Conscious cognitive processes, involving cortical consciousness, delay motor responses to affective demands, enabling through thinking. The essential function of cortex is stabilizing non-declarative executive processes, elevating them to a higher cogntive level, i.e., the bound state, referring to working memory. Perceptual/cognitive consciousness, activated via attention, is also a product of uncertainty, with cortical memory-traces being more uncertain and plastic than subcortical ones.

In the Free Energy Principle framework, a Markov blanket serves as a mathematical construct representing the separation and interaction between a system and its surroundings. It encapsulates all the information available to an external observer about the system, but does not provide a complete description due to the inherent unknowability of the states concealed behind it. This includes information about internal states as well as nested Markov blankets within the system. Each level of the brain's neuronal hierarchy functions as a processing stage, capturing relevant information about the environment and the self. The dynamic interdependencies between these layers can be conceptualized as a Markov blanket separating them. This perspective allows us to view the flow of predictions and prediction errors as a process of interacting with nested holographic screens. Ascending prediction errors correspond to retrieving information from a stage, akin to reading from a screen, while actions on the environment involve providing information to the surroundings, akin to writing to a screen. Only the information processed on the Markov blanket is classical and can contribute to conscious experience, with the underlying processing potentially resembling a form of quantum computation. The hierarchical organization of the brain facilitates efficient processing of vast amounts of information through a process of coarse-graining, the process in which information is processed across successive stages of the brain's hierarch. Lower-level details are abstracted and integrated into higher-level summaries as information is processed across successive stages of the hierarchy. Representations towards sensory levels are domain-specific, while those deeper within the hierarchy are domain-general and encompass both interoception and exteroception. This hierarchical arrangement allows for the encoding of increasingly long-term and global features of the environment and the self. Overall, this nested structure of processing stages can be envisioned as successively nested holographic screens, each contributing to the construction of a comprehensive representation of the world at varying levels of abstraction.

The Free Energy Principle may not directly address consciousness, but it provides a framework that can integrate consciousness into a broader scientific understanding. The FEP and its Bayesian approach share common ground with fundamental physics, including quantum, statistical, and classical mechanics. This shared foundation allows for a unified view of different scientific domains. The concept of a "Markov blanket" is central to this framework. It separates the internal states of a system, which represent the system's core, from external states, through the intermediary of sensory and active states. This separation gives the internal dynamics a structure that can be interpreted as making inferences about the external world, in a probabilistic sense. In other words, the internal states of a system can be seen as making educated guesses about what's happening outside of it. When we apply the notion of a Markov blanket to consciousness, we suggest that consciousness is a feature of systems with a specific kind of Markov blanket. This kind has several characteristics: it's irreducible at a certain scale (meaning it can't be broken down further), it operates within the realm of classical mechanics and information, and it's only influenced by sensory states. Meanwhile, active states can affect the external environment in a way that changes its dynamics. In terms of neurobiology, this model implies that consciousness is a trait of brains with an irreducible Markov blanket. The active states within such a brain could be the source of neurotransmitter systems that modulate the brain's external dynamics. The internal states would be the neuronal populations that connect to these modulatory cells, forming a "dynamic core" or a "global neuronal workspace." These internal dynamics are expected to show a kind of coordinated activity with the rest of the brain and body. From a phenomenological perspective, the irreducibility of the Markov blanket means that no subset of internal states can be influenced by active states. This suggests that the internal states of consciousness cannot be altered by mental actions. Consequently, consciousness, if it exists, would be transparent in experience. Consciousness can only be expressed indirectly through active states, implying that consciousness is inherently linked to agency. This becomes clearer when considering the FEP's view of this unique Markov blanket, which appears to take an intentional stance by acting to minimize expected free energy, which includes both knowledge-seeking and goal-directed components.

Our model of consciousness introduces the concept of an "innermost screen," which we describe as a sophisticated control system within the brain. This innermost screen must have enough complexity and flexibility to effectively manage and direct actions in the external world. It does this by influencing lower levels in the brain's hierarchy through direct interventions. The actions taken by this innermost screen are informed by sensory feedback that travels through various layers of the brain, making these layers crucial for maintaining the higher-level functions of the brain. Essentially, the innermost screen can only understand or remember aspects of the world by influencing these subordinate levels, a process central to both agency and consciousness. Interestingly, studies of the brain's functional connectome show that networks involved in shifting from subliminal to conscious perception are part of a highly interconnected "rich club." These networks, which have extensive connections to motor systems and are linked with intentional control, are key targets for brain-computer interface technologies. It might seem unusual to consider the brainstem nuclei, which are involved in arousal and modulate neurotransmitter systems, as part of the active states of this innermost screen. However, this makes sense given their crucial role in regulating consciousness levels, including during sleep. This suggests that all conscious systems possess an innermost screen that manages covert actions like arousal and attention, determining the potential contents of consciousness such as objects, space-time, the self, memories, plans, and imaginative experiences. This model implies an evolutionary perspective where certain neuronal structures, particularly subcortical neuromodulatory systems, have remained relatively unchanged across species. Meanwhile, the complexity behind this innermost screen has evolved, accumulating what might be termed "mental solids". This perspective shifts the traditional view that places the cortex at the apex of cognitive functions, suggesting instead that the cortex supports higher-level concepts which facilitate mental actions at a subcortical level. These mental actions, in turn, influence the sensory inputs to the inner screen, integrating higher cognitive functions with fundamental brain processes.
