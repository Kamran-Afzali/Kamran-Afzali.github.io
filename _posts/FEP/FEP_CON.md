Theories of consciousness are diverse and aim to address different aspects of the phenomenon. Some theories attempt to tackle the "hard problem" of consciousness, which is the question of why and how brain functions are accompanied by conscious experience. Other theories focus on modeling how specific types of experiential content are implemented by neural structures and dynamics. The targets of these theories range from explaining the basic awareness common to all conscious beings to the more complex consciousness found in humans, which includes higher-order cognitive processes like interoception, selfhood, first-person perspective, and theory of mind. Recent trends in consciousness studies advocate for a move towards theoretical unification. The concept of "minimal unifying models" (MUMs) of consciousness has been proposed, which are models that specify only the necessary properties of conscious experience, provide well-defined descriptions that can be further analyzed and extended, and integrate existing theories by highlighting their common assumptions. The FEP-based approaches to consciousness each focus on mapping specific aspects or processes of consciousness. Here, our goal is to show how these models, premised on the FEP, can be integrated in a meaningful way to provide a solid foundation for the study of consciousness.




**Bayesian global workspace** theories are a set of theories that reframe global workspace theory through a Bayesian lens. They explore how information is processed and integrated in the brain, particularly focusing on attentional processes and their connection to consciousness. These theories suggest that consciousness arises from the availability of information within a _"global workspace"_ in the brain, where various brain networks can share information, leading to coherent activity and the integration of information across different brain regions and modalities. Global workspace theory proposes that consciousness is associated with the ability of the brain to broadcast information within this global workspace. It suggests that consciousness emerges from the aggregation of concurrent processes in the brain, allowing for self-organization into larger-scale networks. This framework provides a scientific explanation for how information is projected and integrated in the brain, enabling the formation of integrated representations of the external world. Neuroscientific models based on global workspace theory, such as global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT), propose that consciousness arises from "ignition events" where information is aggregated and broadcast across distributed networks in the brain. Empirical studies using neuroimaging techniques have supported these ideas, showing widespread activation of specific brain regions during conscious perception. Overall, Bayesian global workspace theories offer insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness and its relation to attentional processes. 
 These theories recast the original **global workspace** theory through a Bayesian or free energy principle lens. This includes Bayesian versions of global workspace theory itself, as well as Bayesian versions of the attention schema theory.The original global workspace theory (GWT) was proposed by Baars and Newman in 1994. It was later developed into biologically-grounded models like the global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) by Dehaene, Kerszberg, and Changeux, and the dynamic core hypothesis by Edelman and Tononi. GWT is one of the most popular frameworks in the neuroscience of consciousness.GWT and related models focus on attentional processes and their relation to consciousness. They understand consciousness in terms of the availability and access to information within the brain. This is sometimes characterized as "access consciousness" rather than "phenomenal consciousness", though this distinction is controversial. In the classical GWT, consciousness is associated with the availability of information in a "global workspace" in the brain. This allows different brain networks to broadcast information to each other, enabling the integration of information across modalities. GWT posits a specific scale of brain activity, modeled as a neural network with recurrently-connected levels, where local processes self-organize into a larger network. The GNWT model further develops this, explaining conscious experience as arising from "ignition events" where information is aggregated and broadcast through the global workspace, potentially involving the inhibition of competing processes. GNWT identifies the prefrontal and parietal regions as the loci of these ignition events, with conscious experience resulting from the late activation of these regions.bEmpirical studies using neuroimaging techniques have supported the predictions of GNWT, showing widespread activation of frontal and parietal regions during conscious perception, in contrast with more limited activation for unconscious stimuli. This large-scale ignition connects higher-order conceptual areas to sensory cortices, making information more broadly available between these systems.



The **hard problem of consciousness** refers to the difficulty in explaining why and how we have subjective, first-person conscious experiences from the physical processes occurring in our brains.  It is difficult to explain why these physical processes should also give rise to the felt sensations and subjective experiences that each of us intimately knows - the reddish color you perceive when looking at an apple, the painful feeling of being burned, or the rich quality of hearing a trumpet play. This is the "hard" part of the problem. Subjective conscious experiences seem fundamentally different from the objective, physical processes described by science. There appears to be an "explanatory gap" between the two domains. Even if we fully understood all the brain's physical mechanisms, there would still be a further question of why these processes are accompanied by conscious experience at all. The existence of subjective consciousness seems irreducible to physical facts alone. Proposed solutions involve new fundamental laws connecting physical processes to consciousness, or more radical ideas that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe itself. But there is no agreed upon solution yet. Free Energy Principle can be applied to the **hard problem of consciousness**, with the affect presented as its elemental form and its physiological mechanism located in the upper brainstem. This principle has been used to define neural correlates of consciousness in terms of neural dynamics and computational correlates, which has implications for understanding consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behavior. Consciousness emerges not merely as a byproduct of neurophysiological activities but as a profound interplay between mind and body. Memory, as both a psychological and physiological process, underscores the interconnectedness between mental and physical phenomena. Consciousness, as a mechanism for monitoring internal states in relation to external forces, is inherently tied to affective processes that guide adaptive behavior. Affective states form the basis of consciousness, with emotional learning supplementing innate predictions and shaping conscious experiences. This integration of affective and cognitive consciousness underscores the fundamental role of emotions in guiding adaptive behavior and learning, providing a nuanced understanding of the subjective nature of consciousness. This integration of affective and cognitive consciousness provides insights into the fundamental nature of subjective experience, bridging the gap between philosophical inquiry and empirical findings in neuroscience. Ultimately, the exploration of consciousness invites a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between mind and body, shedding light on one of the most enduring mysteries of human existence.

The next set of models includes the **"winning hypothesis"** account of consciousness, which extends to Bayesian global workspace theories. According to the winning hypothesis approach, the framework of active inference provides a mechanism for inhibition events, potentially integrating or even superseding the classical global workspace theory (GWT) model. The winning hypothesis leverages policy selection and meta-cognitive inference to explain how the contents of conscious experience are generated. In predictive coding, the brain evaluates competing hypotheses about the probable causes of its sensory states. Bayesian global workspace theories suggest that conscious experience corresponds to this kind of inference - the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability given the current data and prior beliefs determines the contents of experience. This view considers attention and perception as distinct but related aspects of prediction error minimization. The accuracy and expected precision of perceptual hypotheses form the "statistical dimensions of conscious perception" - accurate hypotheses minimize prediction error parsimoniously, while precise hypotheses can better ignore noise and pick out relevant inputs. Attention plays a dual role in this framework, adjusting precision weightings and biasing competition among hypotheses. However, conscious perception does not necessarily require both accuracy and precision at the cognitive level - a precise but inaccurate hypothesis could still determine conscious experience, and vice versa. Recent extensions of GWT have specifically leveraged the tools of active inference from the winning hypothesis model. Predictive global workspace theory is a Bayesian version of GWT that implements it using predictive coding. It proposes that consciousness arises in the global workspace, which integrates and processes predictions and prediction errors from across the brain, allowing information to be broadcast throughout distributed networks. Predictive global workspace theory suggests consciousness is a function of the brain's ability to reconcile sensory information with the predictions generated by its internal models. The neuronal dynamics underlying this involve forms of inference with sufficient temporal depth to provide context to incoming cues, which can then be coordinated within the global workspace to enable goal-oriented behavior.


**Attention schema theory** proposes that consciousness arises from the brain's ability to create a model or schema of its own attention processes. This allows the brain to understand and predict its own actions and behaviors, as well as those of others. A Bayesian version of this theory also exists. The basic attention schema theory posits that consciousness is a form of subjective awareness that arises from the attention an agent pays to a given stimulus. The "attention schema" is a simplified model the brain uses to represent its attentional processes to itself, and to inform and direct those processes. According to this theory, whenever we claim to be conscious of something, we are actually using higher-order cognitive processes to introspect on this attention schema and report the information it holds. The schema must be sparse in order to provide an efficient means of controlling more complex processes. The deployment of the attention schema is said to result in the "illusion" of phenomenal consciousness. The proponents of attention schema theory suggest the ethereal and fluid nature of conscious experience is illusory, and that parsimonious explanations of these phenomena can support the theory. A Bayesian version of attention schema theory has also been proposed, which incorporates elements of the "multiple drafts" view. This version builds on Bayesian global workspace theories, arguing that the mere fact a hypothesis has the highest posterior probability is not sufficient to account for the contents of conscious perception. Rather, attentional processes must first reduce the space of possible causes of sensations, and then probe these hypotheses. This ties the "fame in the brain" account back to attention schema theory, providing a deflationary theory of consciousness where apparently essential features of phenomenal consciousness are illusions created by reflexive access. However, the core idea of attention schema theory is largely independent of this illusionism debate.



According to global **workspace theory (GWT)** and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT), lower levels of hierarchical processing in the brain are unlikely to be experienced consciously. This is because these lower levels encode belief structures that unfold too quickly to be represented in the way required for conscious experience. We can understand this core aspect of GNWT by considering the hierarchical, nested structure of neural inference. In the framework of the proposed Markov Blanket Unification Model, the global workspace or "dynamic core" encompasses the irreducible, minimal Markov blanket that receives ascending messages from lower levels of the hierarchy - the classical information on the "sensory sector" of the inner screen. Theories of consciousness based on GWT allow us to model how consciousness integrates, selects, and prioritizes inputs from lower hierarchical levels of the brain (corresponding to the "mental action" mediated by the "active sector" of the **inner screen**). According to GWT and its Bayesian implementations, this "access dimension" of consciousness is realized through "ignition" events and the concurrent inhibition of competing processes. In terms of the free energy principle (FEP) and predictive coding, this would involve the precision-weighting of predictions and prediction errors. This selection of ascending messages is crucial for understanding attention from these perspectives. Mathematical and numerical analyses have shown ignition phenomena to be an emergent property of Bayesian mechanics and free energy minimization under hierarchical generative models. Narrative accounts have also highlighted the role of attentional selection in the Bayesian brain. The scale of conscious contents follows from the hierarchical, nested composition of Markov blankets, where active states of the inner screen intervene causally in lower processing (i.e. mental action). An intermediate level of processing is seen as crucial for realizing mental action and attentional sets, which is supported by models like the "attended intermediate representations" theory. In these intermediate levels, information selected by higher levels is prioritized as a natural part of Bayesian mechanics under hierarchical generative models. GNWT often emphasizes the role of cortical hierarchies in the genesis of conscious experience, though it does not necessarily assume consciousness requires a brain with neocortices or advanced phenotypic characteristics. Finally, the sparsity of the attention schema can be motivated directly in terms of the free energy principle, as the product of finding an optimal balance between complexity and accuracy.



**Integrated world modeling theory (IWMT)** was a comprehensive attempt to identify the underlying principles of theories of consciousness. It proposed that consciousness corresponds to the ongoing generation of predictions about an embodied agent's sensory states, conditioned on causal world models learned through goal-pursuit within an ecological niche. IWMT claimed that consciousness depends on organizing experience according to the Kantian categories of space, time, and cause, which afford compositionality, prediction, and modeling respectively. These coherence-making properties may require forms of agency that allow learning egocentric perspectives and evaluating counterfactuals, enabling subjectivity as a "point of view" on a "lived world." According to IWMT, consciousness is "what it feels like" to generate an integrated representation of the body and world by synergistically combining relevant information sources. This integrated world model enables adaptive action selection and iterative refinement of policies and models. The theory proposed that informational integration is facilitated by "self-organizing harmonic modes" (SOHMs), which are harmonic functions representing coarse-grained dynamics over the brain's white matter topology. SOHMs function as synchronization manifolds, generating joint beliefs and allowing belief propagation via coherent neural signaling. They provide bases for deploying generative models with varying temporal depths, affording counterfactual beliefs. SOHMs are hierarchically structured, with smaller modes modeling rapidly evolving events and larger modes enabling more complex self- and world-modeling. If sufficiently coherent multi-modal integration with egocentric frames is achieved, an agent may iteratively estimate the likely causes of its sensory states, realizing a stream of experience from a point of view on a "lived world." More complex self-models require coupling with frontal cortices to condition estimates on richer causal world models, enabling trajectories of overt and covert actions.

**The self-modeling theory (SMT)** focuses on how the concept of self and experience of selfhood emerges from the brain's workings. It identifies the self as the center of control that connects bodily sensations with movement in external space. The self emerges from a process that integrates sensory information into a generative model representing the self as the cause of those sensations. The self-model is egocentric, centered on the individual's perspective, encompassing both the subjective experience and objective experiences of the self as an entity conserved over space and time. According to SMT, the self is not static, but results from dynamically inferring the probable causes of an agent's sensory states. This active self-model operates beneath conscious awareness, generating an egocentric, perspectival experience directed towards objects and enabling world interaction. SMT also distinguishes between "transparent" mental states, where the process enabling the experience is inaccessible, and "opaque" states where the process itself enters into the content of experience. The self is ultimately an adaptive hypothesis about what causes one's sensory experience. The beast machine approach suggests inference is fundamentally grounded in embodied, allostatic control realized by predictive coding. Conscious experience is constructed from multimodal bodily inputs, especially interoceptive and proprioceptive signals. The brain leverages a generative model with priors about the causes of these interoceptive signals. The conscious self emerges from generating predictions about actions and managing related prediction errors from interoceptive and exteroceptive brain centers. This approach links the stability of embodied selfhood to the differing timescales of motor actions and physiological homeostasis. Motor actions vary situationally, while homeostasis maintains essential variables within a viable range. Stable interoceptive demands enable a persistent sense of self over time. The body and self are mostly experienced transparently, only becoming objects of experience when attention is directed towards specific processes. According to **felt uncertainty theory**, conscious feeling is the experience of a system that minimizes free energy given homeostatic setpoints or "drives." The locus of basic consciousness in the brain is proposed to be a set of upper brainstem structures, with feeling itself deriving from brainstem activity, especially the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and reticular activating system. This theory suggests that the contributions of the cortex to consciousness have been overemphasized, and that the perceptual contents of conscious experience ("mental solids") arise from the top-down constraining effect of cortical structures on brainstem activity. The theory posits that the brain contains a representation of the internal body (homeostatic needs or drives and error signals) and a representation of the external body (as an object of action and perception). Individuals form a map of their own extended bodies as "mental solids" through spatially distributed sensory receptors. The affective representation of the internal body corresponds to need-detector systems (the Freudian "id"), regulating the body through homeostasis. The external, third-person representation of the body is a part of the generative model representing external objects. According to this theory, the maintenance of the external milieu depends on that of the internal milieu, as homeostatic perception and control is a prerequisite for allostatic perception and control. Individuals leverage memories of past events to build up the external body representation and cognition, repurposing them for counterfactual and imaginary projection into the future. The same brain regions (thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits) are involved in these processes, implementing the same functions for perceiving one's body and other bodies as objects in the world. The crucial aspects of the theory are: (1) after each action/perception cycle, residual homeostatic error signals converge on the PAG, where their precisions are prioritized by current salience; (2) the prioritized category (quality) of need is felt; (3) its fluctuating valence is then utilized by ascending reticular activating neurons to modulate the agent's expected precisions in an ensuing action/perception cycle, rendering it voluntary; while (4) the parallel action/perception policies that respond to the non-prioritized needs are executed automatically. The "felt uncertainty" refers to an agent's fluctuating confidence in its currently prioritized effort to maintain homeostasis voluntarily.

The enigma of **consciousness** is one of the most difficult puzzles in philosophy and neuroscience. While it is undeniable that certain organisms possess subjective experiences, description of how these systems become subjects of experience is a challenge. Why is it that the engagement of our cognitive faculties with sensory information results in vivid experiences such as the color blue or the sound of a musical note? The underlying physical processes that give rise to consciousness remain unclear. How do neurophysiological activities produce the experience of consciousness? Attempts to address this question often conceptualize the brain as a producer or cause of consciousness, but such formulations may further complicate rather than clarify the nature of the problem. The relationship between the brain and the mind is not that of a simplistic causal explanations and presenting consciousness to a byproduct of physiological processes fails to capture its essence.

Instead, viewing the body and mind as two facets of the same underlying reality challenges us to reconsider our ontological assumptions. If both body and mind are manifestations of a deeper reality, what substance underpins their existence? Analogous to the relationship between thunder and lightning, this question leads us to ponder the metaphysical equivalent of "electricity" in the realm of consciousness. Clarifying the ontological status of terms like "physical basis" and "neurobiological processes" requires a nuanced understanding of their underlying meaning. Rather than viewing physiological phenomena as distinct from their mental counterparts, we must recognize their interconnectedness. Memory, for instance, is not a tangible entity but a functional process that manifests both psychologically and physiologically. By abstracting underlying functional laws from observable phenomena, we can bridge the apparent gap between conscious experience and its neural correlates.


Contrary to the view, which posits the cortex as the seat of consciousness, recent evidence suggests that consciousness comes from subcortical regions. The cortex, rather than generating consciousness, may serve as a facilitator or stabilizer of affective arousal, transforming it into conscious cognition. This reinterpretation aligns with the remarkable plasticity of the cortex and the hierarchical dependency between brainstem arousal and cortical consciousness. Studies of emotional and cognitive reactions in such beings point to the existence of a basic form of consciousness, rooted in subcortical structures. The efficacy of deep brain stimulation in evoking affective responses further highlights the role of upper brainstem and limbic circuits in generating subjective states.In this view, consciousness emerges as fundamentally affective, rooted in the arousal processes of the upper brainstem. This reformulation challenges traditional paradigms and prompts a reevaluation of the functional mechanisms underlying consciousness. 


The question of **why we feel** is central in neuroscience. At its core, feeling is understood as the registration of bodily states within a biological scale of values, where pleasurable feelings signal improving chances of survival and reproductive success, while unpleasurable feelings signify deteriorating conditions. Feelings are not localized in the cortex but originate in the brainstem and limbic system, to cover autonomic and intrinsic brain states. As mentioned above the shift in focus to the brainstem highlights the primal nature of consciousness, serving as a mechanism for organisms to monitor and regulate deviations from homeostatic equilibrium in unpredictable contexts. Feelings, in this context, enables organisms to prioritize actions and make adaptive choices based on the assessment of relative value attached to different alternatives. Pleasure accompanies a return to homeostasis, while unpleasure signifies deviation from it, prompting the organism to take corrective action. Emotional valence, arising from deviations in homeostatic settling points, serve as signals guiding behavior and learning. By prioritizing needs and opportunities, consciousness emerges as a biological imperative, facilitating survival and adaptation in novel environments. Ultimately, consciousness is quintessentially affective, rooted in the primal imperative of maintaining biological integrity and adapting to the challenges of life. It is through feeling that organisms navigate the uncertainties of existence, ensuring their continued survival and success in the ever-changing landscape of the world.

**Homeostasis**, crucial for the existence and persistence of self-organizing systems like living organisms. Self-organizing systems resist entropy by occupying preferred states, thus maintaining their integrity over time. Three conditions must be met for a system to resist entropy: the presence of a boundary separating internal and external states, a mechanism to register dissipative external forces (sensory states), and a mechanism to counteract these forces (action). The concept of a **Markov blanket**, which establishes boundary conditions and separates the system from the external environment, is central to this explanation. The sensory and active capacities of the blanket allow the system to vicariously infer external states and act upon them based on sensory impressions. This necessitates the incorporation of a model of the world, which serves as the basis for perception and action. Through ongoing processes of hypothesis testing, the system updates its model, optimizing its predictions and minimizing free energy. In the context of nervous systems, all other bodily systems are considered external, with the nervous system performing meta-homeostatic functions on their behalf. Nervous systems co-evolved with other bodily systems to orchestrate multiple homeostatic demands, thus regulating the organism as a whole. The mechanisms this meta-homeostasis involve both physiological and psychological processes, with abstract concepts like inference, belief, and prediction. This abstract ontology allows for a unified explanation of homeostasis and its role in the function of consciousness, bridging the gap between physiological and psychological phenomena.



Solms (2013, 2014) and further Friston (2018) claim that the  **The emergence of consciousness** is rooted in the dynamics of free energy minimization and uncertainty. Initially proposed as the basic function of homeostasis, free energy minimization is performed by brainstem nuclei centrally implicated in the generation of consciousness. Fundamental properties of mind, such as selfhood and intentionality, arise from the dynamics of FE through Markov blankets, which separates the system from the external environment. The imperative for self-organizing systems to monitor their internal states in relation to external forces leads to the emergence of subjective observational perspectives and active forms of subjectivity. In other words, **Consciousness emerges as self-organizing systems monitor their internal states** in relation to potentially annihilatory forces, leading to inherently value-laden processes that is predicated upon the imperative of survival. While proto-mental dynamics involve the computation of subjective values at the level of autonomic homeostasis, the transition to conscious, qualitative mental states revolves around increasing complexity. Qualitative fluctuations in affect arise from continuous comparisons between predicted and actual sensory states, signaling changes in uncertainty and expected consequences of action. This process of precision optimization is inherently affective, with affect playing a central role in engaging with the outside world and determining subjective engagement.


Therefore, **emergence of conscious self-states** is fundamentally rooted in affective states, serving as an alarm mechanism guiding self-organizing systems through situations that rise the variational free energy. While instinctual behaviors provide innate survival tools, they cannot address the complexities of actual environmental niches. Consequently, innate predictions are supplemented through learning from experience, leading to emotional responses when predictions fail to capture all variance. Emotional learning aims to improve predictions. Non-declarative memories, associated with subcortical systems, involve simpler cause-and-effect links and cannot be retrieved as mental images. Declarative memories, processed in cortical systems, readily return long-term memory (LTM) traces to conscious working memory for updating. Conscious cognitive processes, involving cortical consciousness, delay motor responses to affective demands, enabling through thinking. The essential function of cortex is stabilizing non-declarative executive processes, elevating them to a higher cogntive level, i.e., the bound state, referring to working memory. Perceptual/cognitive consciousness, activated via attention, is also a product of uncertainty, with cortical memory-traces being more uncertain and plastic than subcortical ones.

Identifying the fundamental **causal processess that govern conscious experience** necessitates researching the nature of reality itself and how organisms interact with the _reality_ of their environment. The journey through the intricacies of consciousness leads us to a fundamental realization: the level of consciousness is tied to **free energy**. Drawing parallels between thermodynamic concepts and neurophysiological processes, we have already claimed the that arousal (yet free energy), is the cornerstone of wakeful interaction with the environment. This latter is underpinned by surprisal and uncertainty. 

In the Free Energy Principle framework, a Markov blanket serves as a mathematical construct representing the separation and interaction between a system and its surroundings. It encapsulates all the information available to an external observer about the system, but does not provide a complete description due to the inherent unknowability of the states concealed behind it. This includes information about internal states as well as nested Markov blankets within the system. Each level of the brain's neuronal hierarchy functions as a processing stage, capturing relevant information about the environment and the self. The dynamic interdependencies between these layers can be conceptualized as a Markov blanket separating them. This perspective allows us to view the flow of predictions and prediction errors as a process of interacting with nested holographic screens. Ascending prediction errors correspond to retrieving information from a stage, akin to reading from a screen, while actions on the environment involve providing information to the surroundings, akin to writing to a screen. Only the information processed on the Markov blanket is classical and can contribute to conscious experience, with the underlying processing potentially resembling a form of quantum computation. The hierarchical organization of the brain facilitates efficient processing of vast amounts of information through a process of coarse-graining, the process in which information is processed across successive stages of the brain's hierarch. Lower-level details are abstracted and integrated into higher-level summaries as information is processed across successive stages of the hierarchy. Representations towards sensory levels are domain-specific, while those deeper within the hierarchy are domain-general and encompass both interoception and exteroception. This hierarchical arrangement allows for the encoding of increasingly long-term and global features of the environment and the self. Overall, this nested structure of processing stages can be envisioned as successively nested holographic screens, each contributing to the construction of a comprehensive representation of the world at varying levels of abstraction.

The Free Energy Principle may not directly address consciousness, but it provides a framework that can integrate consciousness into a broader scientific understanding. The FEP and its Bayesian approach share common ground with fundamental physics, including quantum, statistical, and classical mechanics. This shared foundation allows for a unified view of different scientific domains. The concept of a "Markov blanket" is central to this framework. It separates the internal states of a system, which represent the system's core, from external states, through the intermediary of sensory and active states. This separation gives the internal dynamics a structure that can be interpreted as making inferences about the external world, in a probabilistic sense. In other words, the internal states of a system can be seen as making educated guesses about what's happening outside of it. When we apply the notion of a Markov blanket to consciousness, we suggest that consciousness is a feature of systems with a specific kind of Markov blanket. This kind has several characteristics: it's irreducible at a certain scale (meaning it can't be broken down further), it operates within the realm of classical mechanics and information, and it's only influenced by sensory states. Meanwhile, active states can affect the external environment in a way that changes its dynamics. In terms of neurobiology, this model implies that consciousness is a trait of brains with an irreducible Markov blanket. The active states within such a brain could be the source of neurotransmitter systems that modulate the brain's external dynamics. The internal states would be the neuronal populations that connect to these modulatory cells, forming a "dynamic core" or a "global neuronal workspace." These internal dynamics are expected to show a kind of coordinated activity with the rest of the brain and body. From a phenomenological perspective, the irreducibility of the Markov blanket means that no subset of internal states can be influenced by active states. This suggests that the internal states of consciousness cannot be altered by mental actions. Consequently, consciousness, if it exists, would be transparent in experience. Consciousness can only be expressed indirectly through active states, implying that consciousness is inherently linked to agency. This becomes clearer when considering the FEP's view of this unique Markov blanket, which appears to take an intentional stance by acting to minimize expected free energy, which includes both knowledge-seeking and goal-directed components.

Our model of consciousness introduces the concept of an "innermost screen," which we describe as a sophisticated control system within the brain. This innermost screen must have enough complexity and flexibility to effectively manage and direct actions in the external world. It does this by influencing lower levels in the brain's hierarchy through direct interventions. The actions taken by this innermost screen are informed by sensory feedback that travels through various layers of the brain, making these layers crucial for maintaining the higher-level functions of the brain. Essentially, the innermost screen can only understand or remember aspects of the world by influencing these subordinate levels, a process central to both agency and consciousness. Interestingly, studies of the brain's functional connectome show that networks involved in shifting from subliminal to conscious perception are part of a highly interconnected "rich club." These networks, which have extensive connections to motor systems and are linked with intentional control, are key targets for brain-computer interface technologies. It might seem unusual to consider the brainstem nuclei, which are involved in arousal and modulate neurotransmitter systems, as part of the active states of this innermost screen. However, this makes sense given their crucial role in regulating consciousness levels, including during sleep. This suggests that all conscious systems possess an innermost screen that manages covert actions like arousal and attention, determining the potential contents of consciousness such as objects, space-time, the self, memories, plans, and imaginative experiences. This model implies an evolutionary perspective where certain neuronal structures, particularly subcortical neuromodulatory systems, have remained relatively unchanged across species. Meanwhile, the complexity behind this innermost screen has evolved, accumulating what might be termed "mental solids". This perspective shifts the traditional view that places the cortex at the apex of cognitive functions, suggesting instead that the cortex supports higher-level concepts which facilitate mental actions at a subcortical level. These mental actions, in turn, influence the sensory inputs to the inner screen, integrating higher cognitive functions with fundamental brain processes.
