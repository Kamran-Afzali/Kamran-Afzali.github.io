The relationship between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a burgeoning area of interdisciplinary exploration, offering a potential framework for integrating the rich insights of psychoanalytic theory with the rigor of computational neuroscience. This convergence has the potential to revitalize psychoanalytic psychotherapies, which have, in recent decades, been marginalized by other therapeutic approaches. At its core, the FEP, proposed by Karl Friston, provides a mathematical model of how living organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing **free energy**, a measure of disorder and surprise. Active inference, a corollary of the FEP, posits that the brain is not a passive recipient of sensory input but an active agent that seeks to predict and control its environment. This framework is not just a theoretical construct, but also a way of understanding the biological and psychological processes that underpin human behavior.

Freud's early "Project for a Scientific Psychology," written in 1895, represents a fascinating, albeit ultimately abandoned, attempt to ground psychological theory in the neurophysiology of his time. Despite its limitations, this work anticipates many concepts now formalized within the frameworks of active inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). While Freud’s "Project" was limited by the available science of his era, its core ideas about energy flow, psychic conflict, and the brain’s drive to maintain a stable state resonate with the principles of active inference and the FEP, suggesting a profound, if indirect, alignment between early psychoanalytic thought and contemporary neuroscience. The FEP can be seen as a formalization and extension of Freud's early ideas, providing a neuroscientific framework for understanding the mechanisms of the mind.

**Freud viewed living things as dynamic energy systems, an idea deeply rooted in the physiology and thermodynamics of his time**. This perspective aligns with the FEP, which posits that all biological systems, including the brain, minimize free energy. According to the FEP, the brain functions as an open, adaptive, and complex system that is constantly attempting to reduce its free energy to resist a natural tendency towards disorder. The FEP describes the function of the mind-brain system as an adaptive biological system.

In the "Project," Freud introduced the concepts of "Bindung" (binding) and "Entbindung" (unbinding) to describe how energy is processed in the nervous system. He proposed that the nervous system's primary function was to discharge activation, but this was modified by an opposing secondary principle that delayed and modified the discharge. This concept is mirrored in the FEP, where the brain is viewed as an engine of prediction that seeks to minimize surprise and uncertainty by converting free energy into bound energy. Unbound energy, in this context, can be understood as a signal of prediction error, while bound energy is a representation that minimizes prediction error by fitting with the world.

Freud's distinction between primary and secondary processes also finds an interesting parallel within the FEP. Primary processes, associated with the id, are characterized by a free flow of energy and hallucinatory wish fulfillment. Secondary processes, linked to the ego, involve bound energy, language, and logic. This dual-process model is similar to the FEP's hierarchical model, in which lower levels of processing are more associated with prediction errors, while higher levels are associated with more stable and complex representations. In the FEP framework, lower levels of processing represent predictions about the external world, while higher levels represent predictions about our own internal states, or self-models.

**Freud also articulated that the purpose of the mental apparatus is to maintain a state of minimal excitation, which is consistent with the FEP, which suggests the brain’s objective is to minimize free energy and prediction error**. The FEP proposes that living systems act to minimize surprise, which is consistent with the notion that organisms try to maintain states within physiological bounds. The brain continuously adjusts its models of the world to minimize surprise by reducing prediction errors, therefore free energy is reduced as the brain's models are improved.

Furthermore, the concept of defense mechanisms, which Freud initially described as an "inhibiting lateral investment" to protect the subject from trauma by blocking free association, also aligns with the FEP. In the FEP framework, defense mechanisms can be seen as ways of altering the precisions of beliefs in order to minimize expected free energy and uncertainty. According to the FEP, defense mechanisms are a way to maintain a predictable model of the world.

**One of the most compelling aspects of the FEP is its potential to formalize and quantify concepts that Freud struggled with, such as psychic energy and conflict**. While Freud’s attempt to quantify conflict in terms of psychic energy encountered challenges, the FEP offers a way to quantify conflict as the free energy of competing policies. In this context, conflict arises when there is no clear winner amongst competing actions, and beliefs about what action to take have a low precision. Free energy is an information theoretic concept, not a physical energy, and can be mathematically analyzed to account for the dynamics of mental processes.

Freud’s "Project" was an attempt to ground psychology in the natural sciences, specifically in the physiology of the brain. Although he had to abandon this endeavor due to the limitations of his time, the FEP, with its basis in neurophysiology and information theory, aligns with Freud’s original vision of understanding the mind as a function of the brain. Freud's notion of "contact-barriers" in the "Project," which served as mechanisms for memory, bear a striking resemblance to the modern concept of synapses, which are the contact points between neurons.

The alignment between Freud's "Project" and active inference/FEP is remarkable. While Freud's work was constrained by the scientific limitations of the 19th century, his core intuitions about the dynamic and energetic nature of the mind, its drive for stability, and the mechanisms of conflict and defense are echoed in the contemporary neuroscientific framework provided by active inference and the FEP. The FEP can be understood as a formal and quantifiable extension of Freud's early ideas, giving new life to some of his most challenging and enduring concepts.


**Free association**, a cornerstone of psychoanalytic practice, also takes on a new light when viewed through the lens of the FEP. In this process, patients are encouraged to verbalize whatever comes to mind, without censorship, a practice that appears initially to increase "free" energy by allowing the emergence of chaotic and uncensored thoughts. However, this process is crucial in allowing for a deeper exploration of subjective experience and the transformation of internal models that may be maladaptive. It is a process which promotes a move towards the integration of implicit experiences and secondary processes, which leads to symbolization and transformation of emotional states. This is significant because it suggests that free association, while appearing to increase chaos in the short term, is ultimately a tool to help the patient develop a more integrated understanding of the self and the world and thereby reduce free energy over the long term. In a similar vein, dream analysis, another fundamental aspect of psychoanalysis, can be seen as a method for the mind to process and bind free energy, using narrative to address life's challenges. Dreams, often understood as a window into the unconscious, can be viewed as a process of reducing complexity through the consolidation and reconsolidation of memory and the integration of primary and secondary processes that allow for a more complete understanding of the world. These processes also align with the FEP's minimization of free energy through better models of the world and the self.

**Transference** provides another opportunity to understand a classic psychoanalytic concept within the framework of the FEP and active inference. Transference, in which patients unconsciously transfer patterns of feelings and behaviors from past relationships onto their therapist, can be interpreted as a powerful example of entrenched “priors”, that is, pre-existing expectations which are resistant to change in light of new experiences. The therapist’s ambiguous presence in the therapeutic relationship allows patients to challenge these assumptions and develop richer narratives about intimate relationships. This process is further enhanced by the concept of **projective identification**, in which individuals shape interactions to fit pre-existing internal fantasies, which may be regarded as the attempt to control free energy in the context of intimate relationships. These concepts underscore the role of relationships and the social world in shaping our understanding of reality and in our ability to reduce uncertainty. Defense mechanisms, common in psychoanalytic theory, are also understood through an FEP lens as strategic **recalibrations of precisions** at superordinate levels of the generative model, which constrain its development to maintain a stable attractor state. These mechanisms work to reduce the complexity and surprise associated with certain mental states and information by restricting how they are processed, limiting free energy and reducing the risk of destabilization.

The **therapeutic relationship** itself can be seen as a dynamic interaction within the context of the FEP. This therapeutic relationship can be viewed as a "duet for one," in which the therapist collaborates with the patient to create a safe and predictable environment in which to explore emotional states and to minimize free energy. A key aspect of the therapeutic interaction involves altering the computation of precisions related to expected free energy. The non-partisan stance of the therapist enables the patient to confront trauma without being overwhelmed by psychic entropy. The psychoanalytic setting, in this view, provides a container that regulates and "manipulates" free energy. A porous or unstable therapeutic setting can hinder progress by introducing variability and unpredictability, which may impede the process of reducing free energy. This makes the therapeutic setting a crucial element in the process.

Furthermore, neurobiological research provides increasing support for the FEP as a plausible model of brain function. Studies on the Default Mode Network (DMN) suggest it plays a role in the transition from primary to secondary processes, consistent with Freud’s concept of the ego and with its role in suppressing free energy from lower-level brain activity. The DMN is also implicated in higher mental functions, including meta-cognition and reflexivity, emphasizing its role as a mediator between primary and secondary thought processes. The brain as a whole can be seen as a system that works to optimize its representation of the sensorium, minimizing free energy and maximizing model evidence. The FEP helps to understand how neural systems motivate differing plans of action and how conflict arises when these plans have similar expected free energy. This is fundamental to understanding internal conflict and its role in mental distress.

The FEP thus offers a potentially unifying framework for understanding a wide array of psychological processes, spanning from perception and attention to action. Crucially, it provides a bridge between mind and brain, allowing for a formalization of psychoanalytic concepts within a neuroscientific framework. The integration of the FEP and active inference allows psychoanalysis to gain a robust scientific grounding, while psychoanalysis offers valuable insights into the psychotherapeutic process. Future research could investigate how the therapeutic relationship influences free energy computations, and how computational models of active inference could simulate psychotherapeutic processes and validate existing hypotheses. Though the FEP has immense power as a framework for understanding the mind, there are also limits to the epistemological approach to psychic states. Some aspects of the unconscious as it emerges in the free associative process might remain inaccessible to direct representation, and more work is needed in order to determine how to best integrate the subjective experience of the therapeutic process with formal models of the mind.

In conclusion, the relationship between the FEP, active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a promising avenue for integrating the theoretical depth of psychoanalysis with the scientific rigor of computational neuroscience. The FEP provides a unique lens through which to understand diverse psychological functions, the processes underlying psychotherapeutic change, and the complex interplay between the brain and the mind.
