## Active inference and psychoanalysis how aligned are the frameworks?


The relationship between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a burgeoning area of interdisciplinary exploration, offering a potential framework for integrating the rich insights of psychoanalytic theory with the rigor of computational neuroscience. This convergence has the potential to revitalize psychoanalytic psychotherapies, which have, in recent decades, been marginalized by other therapeutic approaches. At its core, the FEP, proposed by Karl Friston, provides a mathematical model of how living organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing **free energy**, a measure of disorder and surprise. Active inference, a corollary of the FEP, posits that the brain is not a passive recipient of sensory input but an active agent that seeks to predict and control its environment. This framework is not just a theoretical construct, but also a way of understanding the biological and psychological processes that underpin human behavior.

#### Project

Freud's early "Project for a Scientific Psychology," written in 1895, represents a fascinating, albeit ultimately abandoned, attempt to ground psychological theory in the neurophysiology of his time. Despite its limitations, this work anticipates many concepts now formalized within the frameworks of active inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). While Freud’s "Project" was limited by the available science of his era, its core ideas about energy flow, psychic conflict, and the brain’s drive to maintain a stable state resonate with the principles of active inference and the FEP, suggesting a profound, if indirect, alignment between early psychoanalytic thought and contemporary neuroscience. The FEP can be seen as a formalization and extension of Freud's early ideas, providing a neuroscientific framework for understanding the mechanisms of the mind.

**Freud viewed living things as dynamic energy systems, an idea deeply rooted in the physiology and thermodynamics of his time**. This perspective aligns with the FEP, which posits that all biological systems, including the brain, minimize free energy. According to the FEP, the brain functions as an open, adaptive, and complex system that is constantly attempting to reduce its free energy to resist a natural tendency towards disorder. The FEP describes the function of the mind-brain system as an adaptive biological system.

In the "Project," Freud introduced the concepts of "Bindung" (binding) and "Entbindung" (unbinding) to describe how energy is processed in the nervous system. He proposed that the nervous system's primary function was to discharge activation, but this was modified by an opposing secondary principle that delayed and modified the discharge. This concept is mirrored in the FEP, where the brain is viewed as an engine of prediction that seeks to minimize surprise and uncertainty by converting free energy into bound energy. Unbound energy, in this context, can be understood as a signal of prediction error, while bound energy is a representation that minimizes prediction error by fitting with the world.

Freud's distinction between primary and secondary processes also finds an interesting parallel within the FEP. Primary processes, associated with the id, are characterized by a free flow of energy and hallucinatory wish fulfillment. Secondary processes, linked to the ego, involve bound energy, language, and logic. This dual-process model is similar to the FEP's hierarchical model, in which lower levels of processing are more associated with prediction errors, while higher levels are associated with more stable and complex representations. In the FEP framework, lower levels of processing represent predictions about the external world, while higher levels represent predictions about our own internal states, or self-models.

**Freud also articulated that the purpose of the mental apparatus is to maintain a state of minimal excitation, which is consistent with the FEP, which suggests the brain’s objective is to minimize free energy and prediction error**. The FEP proposes that living systems act to minimize surprise, which is consistent with the notion that organisms try to maintain states within physiological bounds. The brain continuously adjusts its models of the world to minimize surprise by reducing prediction errors, therefore free energy is reduced as the brain's models are improved. **One of the most compelling aspects of the FEP is its potential to formalize and quantify concepts that Freud struggled with, such as psychic energy and conflict**. While Freud’s attempt to quantify conflict in terms of psychic energy encountered challenges, the FEP offers a way to quantify conflict as the free energy of competing policies. In this context, conflict arises when there is no clear winner amongst competing actions, and beliefs about what action to take have a low precision. Free energy is an information theoretic concept, not a physical energy, and can be mathematically analyzed to account for the dynamics of mental processes.

Freud’s "Project" was an attempt to ground psychology in the natural sciences, specifically in the physiology of the brain. Although he had to abandon this endeavor due to the limitations of his time, the FEP, with its basis in neurophysiology and information theory, aligns with Freud’s original vision of understanding the mind as a function of the brain. Freud's notion of "contact-barriers" in the "Project," which served as mechanisms for memory, bear a striking resemblance to the modern concept of synapses, which are the contact points between neurons. The alignment between Freud's "Project" and active inference/FEP is remarkable. While Freud's work was constrained by the scientific limitations of the 19th century, his core intuitions about the dynamic and energetic nature of the mind, its drive for stability, and the mechanisms of conflict and defense are echoed in the contemporary neuroscientific framework provided by active inference and the FEP. The FEP can be understood as a formal and quantifiable extension of Freud's early ideas, giving new life to some of his most challenging and enduring concepts.


### Dreams

The alignment between active inference, the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and the psychoanalytic understanding of dreams reveals how dreams can be seen as a fundamental process for minimizing surprise and shaping our understanding of the world. Psychoanalysis considers dreams as a crucial pathway to the unconscious, and the FEP offers a complementary perspective by suggesting that dreams serve to refine our generative models and reduce free energy.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, **dreams are the "royal road to the unconscious"**, offering a glimpse into our hidden desires and traumatic experiences. Freud proposed that during sleep, the psychic energy is freer, leading to the expression of desires in a hallucinatory manner. The FEP echoes this by suggesting that dreams represent a state where the usual constraints on our generative models are relaxed, allowing for the exploration of different scenarios and the integration of new information.

The FEP suggests that **the brain is continuously attempting to minimize its free energy, which can be achieved by either changing the world or updating its internal models**. Dreams, in this context, can be understood as a form of "virtual reality" where the brain simulates possible future scenarios to prepare for potential challenges and reduce prediction error. By playing out these scenarios, the brain can refine its predictive models and reduce the likelihood of being surprised by future events. 

Likewise, **dreaming elaborates trauma so that it becomes thinkable**. This process involves a state of "letting go", which allows the emergence of simple and elegant solutions. **Psychoanalytical therapies catalyze these meaning and narrative processes, helping to regulate the psyche's energetic dynamics**. The psychoanalytic approach considers that dreams express unconscious desires and traumatic experiences. The therapist pays attention to the patient's dreams and proposes interpretations about their meaning. **Dreams create a "virtual reality space" that allows for exploration of desires and traumatic experiences that have not been integrated**.



The concept of dreams in psychoanalysis has long been a subject of intrigue, offering a window into the unconscious mind and the hidden mechanisms that govern thoughts and behaviors. Freud’s work in the early 20th century established dreams as a form of psychological processing, a manifestation of repressed desires, unresolved conflicts, and a method for the psyche to cope with unconscious material. At the same time, the concept of active inference, rooted in modern neuroscience, provides a computational framework for understanding how the brain predicts, processes, and adapts to sensory inputs. The free-energy principle, a core idea within active inference, proposes that the brain strives to minimize surprise by updating predictions based on sensory feedback. This theory has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding cognition, perception, and even complex behaviors like emotion regulation and memory suppression. When examined through the lens of active inference, psychoanalytic concepts like dreams may reveal a deeper connection between unconscious processing, the regulation of internal conflicts, and the brain's adaptive strategies for maintaining homeostasis. This error-minimizing approach is akin to the brain’s need to resolve conflict or anxiety, often represented symbolically in dreams. Dreaming can be viewed as a type of prediction process wherein the brain attempts to integrate unconscious material into a coherent, albeit sometimes distorted, narrative. This aligns closely with Freud’s idea of dreams as a form of "wish fulfillment," where unconscious desires are played out in symbolic forms. The brain’s drive to resolve contradictions, represented as internal conflicts, may be a key motivator for the creation of dreams, as the mind seeks to integrate these conflicts into a less threatening form, thus reducing the surprise or cognitive dissonance associated with unresolved thoughts.

From a neurobiological standpoint, the suppression of unwanted memories or thoughts is a form of active inference that involves the brain’s attempts to reduce prediction error by blocking or reinterpreting sensory inputs that conflict with existing models of the world. Research has shown that certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, are involved in controlling the inhibition of unwanted thoughts or memories, a process that is vital to the regulation of emotional responses and the management of internal conflicts. This is where the intersection between defense mechanisms, like repression, and active inference becomes apparent. As active inference models suggest, the brain constantly attempts to adjust its predictions based on new data. When these predictions are challenged by emotionally overwhelming stimuli or unconscious conflicts, defense mechanisms like repression or dissociation come into play. Dreams, in this framework, might serve as an adaptive mechanism for resolving these conflicts by processing them in a controlled, albeit indirect, manner. In other words, the brain uses dreams to simulate potential solutions to emotional conflicts in a way that minimizes the emotional "cost" of confrontation with painful or repressed memories.


Research on neural systems that underlie memory suppression and conflict resolution provides further evidence of the relationship between dreams and active inference. Studies have demonstrated that the brain engages in inhibitory control to suppress intrusive memories, a process that can be viewed as an attempt to minimize the "free energy" associated with distressing or unresolved thoughts. In psychoanalytic terms, the dynamic between repression and defense mechanisms can be understood as an adaptive function of the mind’s effort to regulate emotional conflict. The suppression of unwanted thoughts is particularly relevant in the context of traumatic memories or unresolved conflicts, which may be symbolically reprocessed in dreams. Just as the brain actively works to suppress certain memories, dreams may serve as a space for the brain to "revisit" these suppressed thoughts in a way that resolves emotional conflict without overwhelming the conscious mind.

In psychoanalysis, the concept of "dream work" refers to the process by which repressed material is transformed and expressed in disguised, symbolic forms. This transformation can be seen as the brain’s method of reducing the intensity of emotional conflicts while still allowing the unconscious material to surface in a manageable form. Active inference models, particularly those incorporating hierarchical predictive coding, provide a compelling explanation for this process. In hierarchical predictive coding, higher-level cognitive structures generate predictions about the world, while lower-level structures provide sensory feedback that either confirms or contradicts these predictions. In the context of dreams, the brain could be seen as creating a simulated environment where unresolved conflicts or desires are represented symbolically. This simulation helps to reduce the uncertainty (or free energy) associated with confronting unconscious material directly, allowing the brain to "test" different scenarios and potential outcomes in a low-risk environment. By doing so, the brain can reconcile the need for emotional regulation with the imperative to resolve internal conflicts, providing a space for adaptive psychological processes.

The role of active inference in understanding defense mechanisms like repression and dissociation also highlights the importance of prediction error minimization in psychological functioning. Defense mechanisms, in this view, serve as adaptive responses to emotional conflict, aimed at reducing the discomfort associated with unresolved psychological material. Dreams, as a form of cognitive processing, may therefore function as a space where repressed content is indirectly confronted and reprocessed. The brain’s capacity for hierarchical active inference, which allows for the integration of new information in the face of uncertainty, can help to explain how defense mechanisms like repression might operate in the context of dreaming. Just as the brain uses active inference to reconcile discrepancies between predictions and sensory inputs, dreams could be seen as a tool for processing the emotional and cognitive "discrepancies" created by internal conflict, ultimately facilitating the resolution of these tensions without conscious awareness. By viewing dreams through the lens of active inference and the free-energy principle, it becomes clear that dreams serve as a dynamic, adaptive mechanism for reducing psychological conflict and minimizing emotional surprise. The brain’s efforts to update its internal models and reduce prediction error provide a neurobiological basis for understanding the symbolic transformation of unconscious material in dreams. Ultimately, the intersection of these two frameworks reveals the ways in which the brain uses dreams to manage conflict, regulate emotions, and maintain cognitive stability, highlighting the complex and sophisticated nature of the mind’s mechanisms for psychological homeostasis.

### Desire
The alignment between active inference, the Free Energy Principle, and the concept of desire in psychoanalysis creates a framework for understanding motivation, affect, and the interactions between internal states and external actions. Along these lines, **desire (similar and potentially related to free enery) is an active force, shaping perception, cognition, and behavior**, not a passive feeling. Psychoanalysis understands the mind as a system influenced by unconscious desires and conflicts. Freud's work explored psychic energy and how mental processes reduce tension and seek pleasure. The FEP provides a lens to revisit these concepts with a quantifiable, information-theoretic approach to psychic energy. Active inference, based on the FEP, suggests that organisms reduce free energy by inferring the causes of sensations. This minimization involves: **Action:** Changing the external world to match internal expectations, **Perception:** Updating internal models to better predict sensory input.

Desire drives both action and perception, guiding the organism toward predictable states.

The FEP integrates subcortical emotions with cortical predictive models. The mind maintains homeostasis, and predictions are motivated by desires and wishes, supporting the idea that "all thinking is wishful-thinking".

Within active inference, **desire links to action and exploration**. Active inference is enhanced by seeking help and collaboration, a process where individuals refine their understanding of the world. Blocked explorations to reduce free energy may be responsible for psychological illness. Psychoanalysis evokes and then quiets trauma-related unbound energy through free association, dream analysis, and transference analysis.

One way to view **desire is through a linguistic model, where individuals are signifiers in a chain of meaning**. Desire drives individuals to seek the signified object, creating an interplay between subjects. Complexity theory suggests this is a process of partial synchronization where individuals influence internal states.

Affect is key in active inference, serving as an intrinsic motivator. **Free energy is aversive, like mental pain, while reducing it is rewarding**, so positive and negative affects drive the organism to minimize free energy, shaping behavior.

**Expected free energy** formally describes action selection, where the likelihood of choosing an action decreases with the expected free energy. An organism experiencing thirst seeks water because that action is predicted to result in the lowest expected free energy, aligning with the psychoanalytic idea that gratifying an instinct reduces free energy.

Some researchers note the role of **"first priors,"** prioritized predictions related to the body's internal states and the organism's lifestyle. These underpin habits, skills, and social/cultural norms, shaping sense-making.

Motivation and desire are the divergence between an individual's current state and their anticipated future state achieved through action. Expected prediction errors, which quantify the difference between expected and preferred outcomes, drive individuals to reduce this divergence.

**The environment is experienced through desire, presenting "inviting affordances."** Desire drives improving one's "grip" on these affordances, guiding action and shaping interaction with the world.

Freud’s theory of desire revolves around the tension between instinctual drives and the regulatory mechanisms of the psyche, primarily expressed through the id, ego, and superego. The id is the reservoir of instinctual energy, constantly pushing for immediate gratification, while the ego and superego function as regulatory structures that manage these impulses in accordance with reality and moral considerations. In this context, repression serves as a key defense mechanism that keeps unacceptable desires from reaching conscious awareness. However, these desires persist, manifesting in symptoms, dreams, and other unconscious formations. The notion of repression aligns closely with the predictive processing perspective of active inference, wherein the brain suppresses or modifies certain predictions to maintain cognitive stability (Anderson & Hanslmayr, 2014).

From an active inference perspective, desire can be understood as a form of expected free energy minimization. Free energy, in this context, refers to the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory input. In this framework, the mind constructs generative models that anticipate future states, actively shaping perception and behavior. When an individual experiences a desire, it reflects a prediction of a future state that minimizes uncertainty or distress. The fulfillment of a desire is thus an attempt to resolve this predictive discrepancy, aligning with Freud’s concept of wish fulfillment (Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2010). However, when the expression of a desire is inhibited due to social, moral, or internalized constraints, the mind must reconcile this predictive mismatch, leading to repression or displacement (Connolly, 2018).

A key insight from active inference is that repression is not merely a passive blockage of desire but an active inferential process that minimizes cognitive dissonance. The suppression of unwanted memories, as explored in research by Anderson et al. (2004), demonstrates that neural systems actively inhibit specific representations to align with an individual's generative model. This aligns with Freud’s concept of repression, where the ego exerts control over unconscious content to maintain psychological equilibrium. In this sense, desire is both a force pushing toward realization and a target of regulatory mechanisms that constrain it based on social and cognitive imperatives.

Desire also plays a crucial role in the structuring of selfhood, particularly through the interplay of the default mode network (DMN) and active inference processes. Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) have proposed that the DMN, a network associated with self-referential thinking and autobiographical memory, operates as a high-level generative model that constrains lower-level inferences. This network is implicated in maintaining ego functions, including the management of desire. The suppression or regulation of desire can be seen as an adaptive process that ensures the stability of self-representations. When these regulatory mechanisms fail, as in certain psychopathologies, intrusive desires and maladaptive behaviors can emerge, mirroring psychoanalytic concepts of neurosis and fixation (Friston et al., 2015).

Hierarchical active inference provides a structured way to understand the gradation of desires and their influence on behavior. Pezzulo, Rigoli, and Friston (2018) describe hierarchical active inference as a model in which high-level goals shape lower-level sensory and motor predictions. This framework suggests that desire operates at multiple levels of abstraction, from basic physiological needs to complex social and existential aspirations. The repression or transformation of desire, a core psychoanalytic process, can thus be seen as a hierarchical adjustment where high-level models constrain the expression of lower-level impulses. This perspective aligns with Lacanian theories of desire, which emphasize the symbolic structuring of desire through language and social norms.

Moreover, research on the inhibitory control of memory and emotion regulation supports the notion that desire is actively managed through neural mechanisms. Depue et al. (2015) highlight the role of the right prefrontal cortex in inhibitory regulation across cognitive, emotional, and motor domains. This suggests that the regulation of desire is not merely a learned social convention but an intrinsic feature of brain function, enabling individuals to navigate conflicting motivations. The ability to modulate desire is essential for adaptive behavior, as excessive inhibition can lead to psychological rigidity, while insufficient inhibition can result in impulsivity and distress.

The active inference framework also provides insights into the paradoxical nature of desire, where repression can sometimes intensify the very desires it seeks to suppress. The phenomenon of ironic process theory, wherein efforts to suppress thoughts make them more salient, can be understood in terms of predictive coding. When a desire is repressed, the generative model still anticipates its fulfillment, creating a persistent prediction error. This sustained mismatch can lead to increased salience of the repressed content, manifesting in symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, or somatic expressions (Gray, Bargh, & Morsella, 2013). This paradox is a central theme in psychoanalysis, where unfulfilled desires return in disguised forms, reinforcing the notion that repression is an active and dynamic process. The alignment between active inference and the concept of desire in psychoanalysis offers a powerful synthesis that bridges computational neuroscience with depth psychology. Desire, from this perspective, is an inferential process that involves predicting and resolving discrepancies between internal states and external realities. Repression, inhibition, and transformation of desire are not merely defensive strategies but active processes that shape cognition and behavior through hierarchical inference mechanisms. This integration provides a novel framework for understanding the dynamic nature of desire, shedding light on its manifestations in both normal and pathological states. By combining psychoanalytic insights with contemporary models of brain function, this perspective enriches our understanding of human motivation and the intricate ways in which the mind negotiates its deepest longings and fears.

## Active Inference Account of Defense mechanisms 

In psychoanalysis, defense mechanisms are understood as unconscious strategies employed by the ego to protect itself from distressing or conflicting thoughts and feelings. These mechanisms, such as repression, denial, and projection, operate by distorting or blocking awareness of unacceptable impulses or traumatic memories. From an FEP perspective, these mechanisms are not seen as dysfunctions but as adaptive processes that minimize surprise and maintain a stable model of the world by modifying the way the mind processes information. In this view, the brain is constantly predicting the causes of its sensations, and defense mechanisms are a way of altering predictions to reduce the experience of surprise or uncertainty. The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and defense mechanisms in psychoanalysis offers a compelling perspective on how the mind manages internal conflict and maintains stability. While traditional psychoanalytic theory describes defense mechanisms as primarily driven by the ego to avoid anxiety, the FEP provides a computational framework for understanding these processes as strategies to minimize prediction errors, resolve uncertainty, and maintain a coherent model of the world. **In essence, the FEP views defense mechanisms not merely as ways to avoid unpleasant feelings, but as active inferences aimed at reducing the brain's overall free energy.**


**Defense mechanisms are not static; they are learned and shaped by experience**. The FEP suggests that these mechanisms become entrenched over time as constraints on the future development of the generative model. In other words, if a particular defense mechanism has been successful at reducing prediction error, the brain is likely to rely on it again in similar situations. This can lead to rigid patterns of behavior and thought that are resistant to change, which can be seen as contributing to psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the brain can become trapped in a self-sustaining pattern of behavior if the priors associated with defensive responses become too entrenched.

Importantly, the FEP framework implies that defense mechanisms are not always maladaptive. In many cases, they may serve a necessary function of protecting the individual from overwhelming emotions or conflicts. However, when these mechanisms become too rigid or pervasive, they can limit a person's capacity for adaptation and growth. **Therapy, from this perspective, becomes a process of reducing the precision of these defensive responses to allow the individual to experience and integrate previously avoided feelings and thoughts**. In essence, the therapeutic process allows for a re-evaluation of previously suppressed representations by creating a safe environment where the client can explore and reduce the rigidity of their existing priors.

The alignment between active inference/FEP and defense mechanisms in psychoanalysis offers a new way of understanding how the mind manages conflict and maintains stability. The FEP provides a computational explanation for why defense mechanisms are used, and how they can become entrenched over time and also how they can be addressed in therapy. **By viewing defense mechanisms as active inferences aimed at minimizing prediction error, the FEP framework provides a bridge between the language of psychoanalysis and modern cognitive neuroscience**.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, repression is a defense mechanism in which a person unconsciously blocks unacceptable thoughts or memories from entering conscious awareness. In the FEP framework, this can be understood as a process of assigning low precision to the suppressed representation, making it less likely to be activated, thereby reducing the prediction error associated with that particular thought or memory. In a sense, the brain predicts that the suppressed memory should not enter consciousness, thereby minimizing the surprise that would occur if it did. Similarly, projection, in which a person attributes their own unacceptable feelings or impulses to others, could be seen as a way of reducing prediction error by aligning one’s own experience with an externalized version of the conflict. By attributing their feelings to others, a person avoids having to acknowledge their own internal conflict, minimizing the associated surprise.

The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and projective identification in psychoanalysis provides a framework for understanding how individuals shape their environments to fit their internal models. In psychoanalysis, **projective identification is a process where a person projects their own unwanted thoughts or feelings onto another person, who then unconsciously embodies those projections**. From an active inference perspective, this can be seen as an attempt to reduce prediction error by creating a world that confirms one's expectations.

Active inference suggests that the brain continuously attempts to minimize its free energy by either changing its internal models or influencing the external world. **Projective identification can be understood as a strategy where, instead of changing internal models, an individual manipulates their environment, particularly interpersonal relationships, to align with pre-existing beliefs**. For example, someone who anticipates being abandoned may unconsciously provoke others to leave them, thereby confirming their expectation.

From the FEP perspective, **projective identification is an entrenched "prior," inaccessible to updating via active inference**. Instead of revising priors in the light of experience, the individual attempts to shape the interpersonal world in the light of pre-existing phantasies. **In the therapeutic setting, projective identification can manifest in the relationship between therapist and client**. For example, a therapist might "forget" to inform a client about an upcoming break because they have been unconsciously induced by the client's expectation of abandonment. In this way, the therapist is not interpreting the meaning of the projective identification directly, but rather uses it as an opportunity to design experiments to help the client disambiguate their hypotheses about why they behave in the ways that they do.


The relationship between active inference and defense mechanisms is an emerging area of inquiry that bridges cognitive neuroscience, psychoanalysis, and predictive coding theories. Active inference, a principle grounded in the free energy framework, provides a computational and neurobiological account of how organisms minimize uncertainty and maintain homeostasis. Defense mechanisms, originally conceptualized in psychoanalysis, describe unconscious processes that protect individuals from psychological distress. The intersection of these two domains offers a fresh perspective on how the brain regulates emotions and maintains cognitive equilibrium.

Active inference, as formulated by Karl Friston and colleagues, is a framework that explains perception, action, and learning through the minimization of free energy. Free energy, in this context, represents a measure of uncertainty or surprise relative to an agent's internal model of the world. Organisms strive to minimize free energy by continuously updating their beliefs and adapting their actions to align with expected outcomes. The predictive coding framework, which underlies active inference, suggests that the brain operates as a Bayesian machine, continuously generating predictions about sensory inputs and minimizing discrepancies between expectations and reality through perception and action (Friston et al., 2015).

Defense mechanisms, on the other hand, originate from Freudian psychoanalytic theory and have been further elaborated by later psychologists. These mechanisms, such as repression, denial, and projection, serve to manage emotional conflicts and reduce psychological distress. While traditionally viewed as unconscious strategies, contemporary research suggests that they are rooted in neural processes involving inhibitory control, memory suppression, and emotional regulation (Anderson & Hanslmayr, 2014). The neural substrates of defense mechanisms have been increasingly mapped onto cognitive and affective neuroscience, highlighting their role in adaptive and maladaptive behaviors (Depue et al., 2015).

One of the most compelling links between active inference and defense mechanisms lies in the process of motivated forgetting. Studies have shown that individuals can suppress unwanted memories through top-down inhibitory control mechanisms mediated by the prefrontal cortex (Anderson et al., 2004). This process aligns with the principles of active inference, wherein the brain adjusts its internal model to reduce prediction errors associated with distressing memories. Voluntary forgetting, as explored by Benoit and Anderson (2012), demonstrates how individuals actively modulate their mental states to maintain cognitive and emotional stability. This suggests that defense mechanisms can be understood as active inference strategies aimed at minimizing the psychological equivalent of free energy.

The effects of stress on the prefrontal cortex further illuminate the alignment between these two domains. Arnsten et al. (2015) have documented how stress exposure impairs prefrontal regulatory functions, leading to heightened emotional reactivity and maladaptive coping strategies. From an active inference perspective, stress-induced impairments can be seen as disruptions in the predictive coding system, where the inability to effectively update expectations results in maladaptive defense mechanisms such as dissociation or denial. These mechanisms, rather than reducing free energy, may inadvertently increase uncertainty by preventing individuals from accurately predicting and responding to environmental challenges.

Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) have explored how Freudian concepts, particularly ego functions, can be understood through the free energy principle. They argue that the ego, traditionally viewed as the mediator between reality and internal drives, functions as a predictive model that seeks to minimize surprise. In this light, defense mechanisms can be reinterpreted as computational strategies that the brain employs to optimize belief updating and maintain coherence. This perspective integrates psychoanalytic theory with contemporary neuroscience, providing a mechanistic explanation for the function of defenses.

Connolly (2018) extends this idea by formalizing conflict and defense mechanisms within the expected free energy framework. Expected free energy accounts for the future-oriented nature of decision-making, emphasizing the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation in belief updating. Defense mechanisms, in this context, act as regulatory processes that guide individuals toward maintaining a stable sense of self and avoiding states of high uncertainty. For instance, projection, a defense mechanism where an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts to others, can be seen as an active inference strategy that externalizes uncertainty to preserve internal stability.

The regulation of inhibitory control within the prefrontal networks offers further insights into the neurocomputational basis of defense mechanisms. Depue et al. (2015) have demonstrated that common inhibitory mechanisms govern cognitive, emotional, and motor processes. This suggests that defense mechanisms may rely on the same neural circuitry that underlies other forms of regulatory control. From an active inference perspective, these inhibitory processes function to suppress prediction errors associated with negative emotional states, thus facilitating psychological stability.

The free-energy approach to pattern regulation, as discussed by Friston et al. (2015), provides another compelling parallel to defense mechanisms. Pattern regulation refers to the brain's ability to maintain stable representations of self and environment despite fluctuating sensory inputs. Defense mechanisms, particularly those involving identity and self-concept, can be viewed as means of maintaining stable generative models. This perspective aligns with theories of personality and resilience, suggesting that individuals with flexible and adaptive defense mechanisms may exhibit more efficient free energy minimization processes.

Gray et al. (2013) have investigated the neural correlates of conscious conflict, revealing that sustaining incompatible intentions engages prefrontal networks involved in cognitive control. This research supports the idea that defense mechanisms, particularly those related to internal conflict, are deeply intertwined with executive functioning. The ability to manage conflicting predictions, as seen in repression and rationalization, may be critical for reducing cognitive dissonance and minimizing free energy.

The hierarchical nature of active inference, as proposed by Pezzulo et al. (2018), further enriches our understanding of defense mechanisms. Hierarchical active inference suggests that the brain organizes predictions across multiple levels, from immediate sensory inputs to abstract cognitive and emotional representations. This framework explains why defense mechanisms operate at different levels of awareness and complexity. For example, denial, a low-level defense mechanism, may involve simple sensory prediction errors, whereas intellectualization, a higher-level defense, engages complex abstract reasoning to reinterpret distressing experiences.

Streb et al. (2016) have examined the role of memory control abilities in mitigating intrusive memories after trauma. Their findings indicate that individuals with greater memory control exhibit reduced intrusive thoughts, supporting the idea that adaptive defense mechanisms contribute to psychological resilience. This aligns with active inference models, where effective prediction error minimization enables individuals to integrate traumatic experiences without becoming overwhelmed by uncertainty.

Overall, the integration of active inference and defense mechanisms offers a novel framework for understanding psychological resilience and vulnerability. By viewing defense mechanisms as predictive coding strategies, researchers can gain deeper insights into how individuals regulate emotions, maintain self-coherence, and adapt to environmental challenges. This perspective not only bridges cognitive neuroscience with psychoanalysis but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at optimizing belief updating and minimizing maladaptive free energy states. Future research should explore how different defense mechanisms correspond to specific neural processes and computational strategies, further refining our understanding of the brain's predictive capacities in maintaining mental health.

#### The Default Mode Network and Psychoanalytic Concepts in Active Inference

Neuropsychoanalysis is an interdisciplinary field that integrates Freudian psychoanalytic concepts with contemporary neuroscience. One of the most promising frameworks for understanding this intersection is the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its computational instantiation, active inference. This approach, championed by Karl Friston, posits that the brain is fundamentally a predictive machine that minimizes surprise or free energy to maintain homeostasis and adapt to its environment. When applied to psychoanalysis, FEP offers a novel way to interpret core psychoanalytic constructs such as repression, the unconscious, and the id-ego-superego dynamics.

The Free Energy Principle suggests that the brain operates by continuously generating predictions about sensory inputs and updating these predictions based on errors between expectation and reality. This process, called active inference, encompasses perception, action, and cognition, making it a comprehensive model for explaining mental states. In a psychoanalytic context, this means that unconscious defense mechanisms, such as repression and denial, can be understood as mechanisms that minimize free energy by constraining prediction errors. Freud's notion of the unconscious can thus be seen as a set of deeply ingrained predictive models that shape an individual's interpretation of reality while remaining inaccessible to conscious awareness.

One of the earliest discussions linking psychoanalysis to predictive processing comes from Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010), who argue that Freudian ideas align with the brain’s hierarchical organization. The default mode network (DMN), a large-scale brain network associated with self-referential thinking and mind-wandering, has been implicated in ego-functions such as self-regulation and autobiographical memory (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010). Under this framework, the ego can be conceptualized as a hierarchical predictive model that balances internal drives (the id) with social constraints (the superego). This balance is maintained by modulating precision, or the weight given to prediction errors, which aligns with the concept of repression.

Repression, a cornerstone of Freudian theory, is the process by which distressing thoughts and impulses are kept out of conscious awareness. From an active inference perspective, repression can be understood as the down-weighting of sensory prediction errors that would otherwise bring unwanted information into consciousness. This aligns with findings from memory suppression studies, such as those by Anderson et al. (2004), which demonstrate that individuals can inhibit the retrieval of certain memories through top-down control exerted by the prefrontal cortex. In this view, repression is not a passive forgetting process but an active engagement in prediction error minimization.

Another key psychoanalytic concept that finds resonance within the FEP framework is the distinction between primary and secondary process thinking. Freud proposed that the primary process, associated with the id, is governed by pleasure-seeking and operates outside of logical constraints, while the secondary process, mediated by the ego, adheres to reality and structured thought. Solms (2013) argues that these processes can be mapped onto different modes of brain activity, with the DMN supporting spontaneous, unconstrained thought and the central executive network enabling goal-directed reasoning. Active inference provides a computational basis for this distinction by describing how different levels of precision weighting can shift between automatic, implicit processing (primary) and explicit, effortful cognition (secondary).

The role of interoception—the brain’s ability to sense the internal physiological state of the body—is crucial in understanding how emotional and affective states are regulated within the predictive brain model. According to Friston (2010), the regulation of interoceptive signals is fundamental to maintaining homeostasis. Hopkins (2012) explores how interoceptive predictions influence unconscious conflict resolution, aligning psychoanalytic interpretations of anxiety with contemporary neurobiological accounts. When an individual experiences psychological distress, it can be understood as the brain attempting to resolve an irreducible conflict between competing predictive models. This can result in symptoms such as somatization, where unresolved conflicts manifest as physical symptoms.

One of the most intriguing implications of applying FEP to psychoanalysis is in understanding psychodynamic therapy’s effectiveness. If psychopathology arises due to maladaptive predictive models, then therapeutic change must involve updating these models to reduce long-term free energy. Parr and Friston (2019) propose that attention and salience modulation play critical roles in belief updating, which can explain why therapeutic interventions that enhance insight and self-awareness lead to symptom relief. By gradually exposing the patient to repressed content in a controlled manner, psychoanalysis may facilitate the reweighting of prediction errors, allowing for more adaptive models to emerge.

One of the key aspects of this integration is the role of the Default Mode Network (DMN), a large-scale brain network associated with self-referential thinking, mind-wandering, and the processing of autobiographical memories. The DMN is crucial in constructing and maintaining an internal model of the world, which is central to active inference. From a psychoanalytic perspective, the DMN can be seen as playing a role in unconscious processes, particularly in the formation and maintenance of defense mechanisms.

Freudian concepts such as repression and projection can be examined through the lens of active inference, where the brain minimizes prediction errors by selectively inhibiting or modifying incoming information. The DMN, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, appears to be involved in these processes, as it modulates self-related information and emotional regulation. Studies have shown that alterations in DMN activity are linked to various psychiatric conditions, such as depression and PTSD, where maladaptive prediction models contribute to pathological thought patterns.

Furthermore, the DMN interacts with other large-scale networks, such as the salience network and central executive network, to regulate attention and emotional responses. This interaction is crucial in balancing internal cognitive processes with external stimuli, a dynamic that is central to both psychoanalytic theory and active inference. The DMN’s role in integrating past experiences and generating expectations aligns with Freud’s notion of the unconscious mind shaping behavior outside of conscious awareness.

A critical implication of this integrative approach is its potential to unify disparate schools of psychological thought. Traditional psychoanalysis has often been criticized for lacking empirical grounding, while cognitive neuroscience has struggled to incorporate subjective experiences and meaning-making processes. The Free Energy Principle offers a bridge between these fields by providing a mathematically rigorous yet phenomenologically rich account of human cognition. It enables a reframing of psychoanalytic constructs within a computational framework, allowing for testable predictions and interdisciplinary dialogue.

One of the remaining challenges for neuropsychoanalysis within the FEP framework is operationalizing complex psychodynamic constructs in a way that is computationally tractable. While progress has been made in modeling defense mechanisms and affect regulation using predictive coding, further empirical research is required to validate these models against clinical data. As computational psychiatry continues to advance, integrating neuropsychoanalytic insights into predictive processing frameworks could lead to novel diagnostic tools and interventions tailored to individual neurocognitive profiles.

In conclusion, neuropsychoanalysis, when viewed through the lens of active inference and the Free Energy Principle, provides a compelling framework for understanding unconscious processes, defense mechanisms, and the therapeutic process. By conceptualizing the mind as a predictive system that seeks to minimize free energy, longstanding psychoanalytic concepts such as repression, primary and secondary process thinking, and anxiety regulation gain a computational foundation. This interdisciplinary synthesis has the potential to transform both clinical practice and our understanding of the mind, paving the way for a more integrated and empirically grounded approach to mental health.



Psychoanalysis, from its Freudian origins, has attempted to elucidate the intricate relationship between the human mind and its neurobiological underpinnings. Freud's early forays into grounding psychological concepts in neurophysiology, exemplified by his "Project for a Scientific Psychology," faced limitations due to the technological constraints of his time. However, the advent of neural networks, neuroimaging techniques, and the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** has breathed new life into the endeavor of understanding the brain as the physical embodiment of the psyche. This essay aims to explore the alignment between the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, a prominent area of study in contemporary neuroscience, and core psychoanalytical concepts, all viewed through the lens of active inference and free energy minimization.

The **FEP**, championed by Karl Friston, posits that any living organism, to maintain its integrity, must minimize its internal free energy, resisting the entropic forces of disorganization. In this context, **free energy** quantifies the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the sensory information it receives. The brain, functioning as a hierarchical Bayesian inference machine, strives to optimize its representation of the sensorium by minimizing this free energy. This minimization is achieved via action (altering the environment to align with internal predictions) and perception (updating internal models to better reflect the environment).

**Active inference** builds upon the FEP by highlighting the proactive role of organisms in sampling their environment to validate predictions, thereby reducing surprise. This framework provides a comprehensive perspective on perception, attention, and action, underpinned by a simple, physiologically plausible mechanism.

#### The Default Mode Network: A Neural Correlate of the Ego?

The DMN, a network primarily encompassing the **medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)**, **posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)**, and **inferior parietal lobule (IPL)**, exhibits heightened activity during rest and self-referential thought. This network has been linked to the Freudian concept of the **ego**, which mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the constraints of the external world.

Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) propose that the functions of the DMN, such as self-monitoring, introspection, and internal mentation, correspond with the ego's role in maintaining a coherent sense of self and reality. The DMN is believed to contain free energy levels of underlying structures, which aligns with the ego's function in the secondary process. Spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal activity from cortical nodes of the DMN are thought to suppress the unconstrained activity of limbic and paralimbic systems, supporting this view.

The **MPFC-PCC connectivity** is absent in infants and develops through ontogeny, which parallels the emergence of the individual Self with its complex functions. Furthermore, some researchers have defined the DMN as a kind of biomarker of the Self.

#### The Id, Free Energy, and the Limbic System

In contrast to the ego, the **id** represents the unconscious reservoir of instinctual drives and desires, operating on the pleasure principle. Neurobiologically, the id can be associated with subcortical structures such as the **amygdala** and **hypothalamus**, which are central to processing emotions and basic drives. These structures operate at a primary process level, characterized by high entropy and a lack of logical constraints.

Failures of top-down control from the DMN might be associated with an impairment of the supraordinate system, leading to the expression of unconstrained activity from the limbic system. Such failures are observed in non-ordinary states of consciousness such as early and acute psychosis, temporal-lobe aura, dreaming, and hallucinogenic drug states.

#### Conclusion

The active inference framework offers a valuable perspective for examining the neurobiological underpinnings of psychoanalytic concepts and their relationship to the DMN. By mapping psychoanalytic constructs onto brain functions, structures, and networks, this approach fosters a more biologically informed understanding of the mind. Concepts such as free energy, hierarchical inference, and precision weighting provide a common language for psychoanalysis and neuroscience, enabling a deeper exploration of the mind-brain relationship.

The essay has underlined the natural connection between Freudian constructs of the primary and secondary processes and the DMN. Also, it has highlighted the hypothesis according to which the spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal activity from cortical nodes of DMN suppress or contain the unconstrained and anarchic endogenous activity of limbic and paralimbic systems.

However, the complexity of the mind-brain system poses inherent limitations. Psychoanalysis, with its focus on subjective experience and the unconscious, may not be fully captured by neurobiological models.

## Technique and Clinical considerations 


The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and clinical techniques in psychoanalysis, such as free association, transference, and the therapeutic alliance, offers a powerful framework for understanding how these methods facilitate psychological change. The FEP suggests that the brain is constantly working to minimize free energy, which can be understood as prediction error or surprise, and this principle can be applied to the therapeutic process.

**Free association**, a cornerstone of psychoanalytic technique, encourages patients to verbalize whatever comes to mind without censorship. From the perspective of active inference and the FEP, this process can be seen as a way to access and make explicit the implicit generative models that shape a person's experience. By temporarily suspending the usual top-down constraints on thought and speech, free association allows for a wider range of sensory and interoceptive information to enter awareness. This can bring to the surface previously unacknowledged patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving, including repressed memories and emotions. In essence, free association creates a space where the individual’s habitual predictions can be challenged and revised.

The FEP proposes that the brain minimizes prediction error by modifying its internal models of the world. Free association may help to bring to awareness implicit models which might be causing prediction errors, thereby allowing the client to adjust them. The chaotic and stochastic nature of free association can increase free energy, as it introduces a degree of disorder into the psyche. However, this increase in free energy is not necessarily detrimental; it can be a catalyst for change by making the usually hidden and implicit models more explicit. The therapeutic setting provides a safe and containing environment where the patient can explore these high-entropy states, thereby enabling the emergence of new insights. In this way, free association promotes psychic malleability and allows for the exploration of subjective experience in an original manner. **The therapist's role, in this process, is to attend to and reflect back the patterns and themes that emerge in free association, helping the client to make sense of their experience and construct new narratives**. 

**Transference**, another key concept in psychoanalysis, involves the patient unconsciously transferring relational patterns from past relationships onto the therapist. From the perspective of active inference, transference can be understood as the activation of entrenched priors about relationships. These priors, formed early in life, guide our expectations and behavior in interpersonal interactions. When these priors are activated in the therapeutic relationship, they provide an opportunity for the patient to explore and revise them. The therapist’s role is to recognize these transferential patterns and to help the patient become aware of how their past experiences are shaping their present interactions. The therapeutic relationship becomes a space for observing the client's typical patterns of relating, which may not be serving them well.

The FEP framework suggests that transference is a result of the brain trying to predict how people will behave based on previous experiences. When a person's experiences are not working in the present, this becomes a source of prediction error and free energy which the client will want to resolve. **By analyzing the transference, the therapist can help the client to become aware of their underlying models of relationships and to revise these models in a more adaptive direction**. In the therapeutic space, the therapist becomes an "enigmatic signifier" who embodies ambiguity, enabling the patient to experience, reconsider, and extend their top-down assumptions about relationships. The therapist does not interpret the meaning of the transference directly, but rather uses it as an opportunity to design experiments to help the client disambiguate their hypotheses about why they behave in the ways that they do.

**The therapeutic alliance, referring to the collaborative relationship between therapist and patient, is also seen as crucial for therapeutic success from an active inference/FEP perspective**. A strong therapeutic alliance is characterized by mutual trust, respect, and a shared understanding of the goals of therapy. Active inference suggests that effective communication is achieved through a process of aligning mental states, and a strong therapeutic alliance is an example of this. The therapist's ability to mentalize, which refers to the capacity to understand their own and others' mental states, plays a crucial role in the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance. When the therapist can accurately perceive and reflect the patient’s internal world, it helps the patient to feel understood, safe and that the therapist’s generative model is well-aligned to their own. This co-creation of shared meaning enhances the patient’s sense of agency, and creates the safety required to explore difficult emotional terrain.

**From the FEP viewpoint, the therapeutic alliance helps to reduce the client’s overall free energy by providing a predictable and safe environment for exploring previously avoided experiences**. The therapist’s non-partisan stance and capacity to contain difficult emotions helps the patient face trauma and conflict without becoming overwhelmed by psychic entropy. The secure base provided by the therapist allows the client to relax their epistemic vigilance and engage in a collaborative process of active inference, which allows the client to update their own generative model. Touch can also contribute to synchrony and the therapeutic alliance, with repetitive and affectionate touch offering important benefits.

Active inference also highlights the importance of communication in therapy. The therapeutic conversation is not simply a dialogue; it is a process of collaborative sense-making where both client and therapist engage in a shared process of reducing prediction error. **The therapist attempts to understand the client's unique way of seeing the world, and to use language that resonates with the client's "forms of feeling," which helps to enhance alignment and synchrony between their mental states**. The therapist’s use of language that is attuned to the client’s experience also signals the therapist’s attention to the client as a subjective, agentive self. Through this collaborative process, the client can develop a more accurate and flexible model of the world, and more flexible patterns of relating.

In conclusion, the alignment between active inference/FEP and psychoanalytic clinical techniques is not merely a theoretical exercise; it has important implications for how we understand and practice psychotherapy. By viewing free association, transference, and the therapeutic alliance through the lens of active inference and the FEP, we gain a deeper understanding of how these techniques facilitate psychological change. **The therapeutic process is ultimately a collaborative effort to minimize prediction errors, reduce free energy, and create a more integrated and adaptive model of the self and the world**. This perspective has the potential to bridge the gap between psychoanalytic theory and modern neuroscience, bringing the wisdom of psychoanalysis into dialogue with cutting-edge research on the brain and mind.

________

The FEP thus offers a potentially unifying framework for understanding a wide array of psychological processes, spanning from perception and attention to action. Crucially, it provides a bridge between mind and brain, allowing for a formalization of psychoanalytic concepts within a neuroscientific framework. The integration of the FEP and active inference allows psychoanalysis to gain a robust scientific grounding, while psychoanalysis offers valuable insights into the psychotherapeutic process. Future research could investigate how the therapeutic relationship influences free energy computations, and how computational models of active inference could simulate psychotherapeutic processes and validate existing hypotheses. Though the FEP has immense power as a framework for understanding the mind, there are also limits to the epistemological approach to psychic states. Some aspects of the unconscious as it emerges in the free associative process might remain inaccessible to direct representation, and more work is needed in order to determine how to best integrate the subjective experience of the therapeutic process with formal models of the mind.

In conclusion, the relationship between the FEP, active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a promising avenue for integrating the theoretical depth of psychoanalysis with the scientific rigor of computational neuroscience. The FEP provides a unique lens through which to understand diverse psychological functions, the processes underlying psychotherapeutic change, and the complex interplay between the brain and the mind.
