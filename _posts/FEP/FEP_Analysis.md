The relationship between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a burgeoning area of interdisciplinary exploration, offering a potential framework for integrating the rich insights of psychoanalytic theory with the rigor of computational neuroscience. This convergence has the potential to revitalize psychoanalytic psychotherapies, which have, in recent decades, been marginalized by other therapeutic approaches. At its core, the FEP, proposed by Karl Friston, provides a mathematical model of how living organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing **free energy**, a measure of disorder and surprise. Active inference, a corollary of the FEP, posits that the brain is not a passive recipient of sensory input but an active agent that seeks to predict and control its environment. This framework is not just a theoretical construct, but also a way of understanding the biological and psychological processes that underpin human behavior.

Freud’s early work, particularly his "Project for a Scientific Psychology" (1895), aimed to establish a foundation for psychology within the natural sciences, viewing the human being as a dynamic energy system that sought to reduce psychic energy. In this context, Freud's concept of the mind operating to minimize psychic energy aligns remarkably well with the FEP’s principle of minimizing free energy. Freud's ideas about "Bindung" (bound energy) and "Entbindung" (unbound energy) can be interpreted as precursors to the FEP's concepts of minimizing free energy. Unbound energy, according to Freud, was disruptive and a source of psychological symptoms, whereas the goal of psychoanalysis was to evoke and then quiet this energy. This dynamic mirrors the FEP's assertion that the brain operates to minimize surprise and entropy. Furthermore, Freud’s distinction between the primary and secondary processes, associated with the id and ego respectively, closely matches the hierarchical nature of the FEP, where lower-level processes are modulated and organized by higher-level cognitive and control systems. The primary process, characterized by "free-flowing" psychic energy, pleasure, and wish fulfillment is related to the FEP's concept of entropy increase, while the secondary process, which involves language, logic, and reality testing corresponds to the FEP’s drive to organize, refine and integrate models of the world. In this light, the ego can be understood as a system that works to bind energy, reducing the unpredictability and chaos of primary processes, thus acting as a free-energy minimizing agent. The concept of conflict in psychoanalysis can also be reframed through the FEP as a state of tension in which different courses of action have similar expected free energy.

**Free association**, a cornerstone of psychoanalytic practice, also takes on a new light when viewed through the lens of the FEP. In this process, patients are encouraged to verbalize whatever comes to mind, without censorship, a practice that appears initially to increase "free" energy by allowing the emergence of chaotic and uncensored thoughts. However, this process is crucial in allowing for a deeper exploration of subjective experience and the transformation of internal models that may be maladaptive. It is a process which promotes a move towards the integration of implicit experiences and secondary processes, which leads to symbolization and transformation of emotional states. This is significant because it suggests that free association, while appearing to increase chaos in the short term, is ultimately a tool to help the patient develop a more integrated understanding of the self and the world and thereby reduce free energy over the long term. In a similar vein, dream analysis, another fundamental aspect of psychoanalysis, can be seen as a method for the mind to process and bind free energy, using narrative to address life's challenges. Dreams, often understood as a window into the unconscious, can be viewed as a process of reducing complexity through the consolidation and reconsolidation of memory and the integration of primary and secondary processes that allow for a more complete understanding of the world. These processes also align with the FEP's minimization of free energy through better models of the world and the self.

**Transference** provides another opportunity to understand a classic psychoanalytic concept within the framework of the FEP and active inference. Transference, in which patients unconsciously transfer patterns of feelings and behaviors from past relationships onto their therapist, can be interpreted as a powerful example of entrenched “priors”, that is, pre-existing expectations which are resistant to change in light of new experiences. The therapist’s ambiguous presence in the therapeutic relationship allows patients to challenge these assumptions and develop richer narratives about intimate relationships. This process is further enhanced by the concept of **projective identification**, in which individuals shape interactions to fit pre-existing internal fantasies, which may be regarded as the attempt to control free energy in the context of intimate relationships. These concepts underscore the role of relationships and the social world in shaping our understanding of reality and in our ability to reduce uncertainty. Defense mechanisms, common in psychoanalytic theory, are also understood through an FEP lens as strategic **recalibrations of precisions** at superordinate levels of the generative model, which constrain its development to maintain a stable attractor state. These mechanisms work to reduce the complexity and surprise associated with certain mental states and information by restricting how they are processed, limiting free energy and reducing the risk of destabilization.

The **therapeutic relationship** itself can be seen as a dynamic interaction within the context of the FEP. This therapeutic relationship can be viewed as a "duet for one," in which the therapist collaborates with the patient to create a safe and predictable environment in which to explore emotional states and to minimize free energy. A key aspect of the therapeutic interaction involves altering the computation of precisions related to expected free energy. The non-partisan stance of the therapist enables the patient to confront trauma without being overwhelmed by psychic entropy. The psychoanalytic setting, in this view, provides a container that regulates and "manipulates" free energy. A porous or unstable therapeutic setting can hinder progress by introducing variability and unpredictability, which may impede the process of reducing free energy. This makes the therapeutic setting a crucial element in the process.

Furthermore, neurobiological research provides increasing support for the FEP as a plausible model of brain function. Studies on the Default Mode Network (DMN) suggest it plays a role in the transition from primary to secondary processes, consistent with Freud’s concept of the ego and with its role in suppressing free energy from lower-level brain activity. The DMN is also implicated in higher mental functions, including meta-cognition and reflexivity, emphasizing its role as a mediator between primary and secondary thought processes. The brain as a whole can be seen as a system that works to optimize its representation of the sensorium, minimizing free energy and maximizing model evidence. The FEP helps to understand how neural systems motivate differing plans of action and how conflict arises when these plans have similar expected free energy. This is fundamental to understanding internal conflict and its role in mental distress.

The FEP thus offers a potentially unifying framework for understanding a wide array of psychological processes, spanning from perception and attention to action. Crucially, it provides a bridge between mind and brain, allowing for a formalization of psychoanalytic concepts within a neuroscientific framework. The integration of the FEP and active inference allows psychoanalysis to gain a robust scientific grounding, while psychoanalysis offers valuable insights into the psychotherapeutic process. Future research could investigate how the therapeutic relationship influences free energy computations, and how computational models of active inference could simulate psychotherapeutic processes and validate existing hypotheses. Though the FEP has immense power as a framework for understanding the mind, there are also limits to the epistemological approach to psychic states. Some aspects of the unconscious as it emerges in the free associative process might remain inaccessible to direct representation, and more work is needed in order to determine how to best integrate the subjective experience of the therapeutic process with formal models of the mind.

In conclusion, the relationship between the FEP, active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a promising avenue for integrating the theoretical depth of psychoanalysis with the scientific rigor of computational neuroscience. The FEP provides a unique lens through which to understand diverse psychological functions, the processes underlying psychotherapeutic change, and the complex interplay between the brain and the mind.
