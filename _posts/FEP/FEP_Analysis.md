The relationship between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a burgeoning area of interdisciplinary exploration, offering a potential framework for integrating the rich insights of psychoanalytic theory with the rigor of computational neuroscience. This convergence has the potential to revitalize psychoanalytic psychotherapies, which have, in recent decades, been marginalized by other therapeutic approaches. At its core, the FEP, proposed by Karl Friston, provides a mathematical model of how living organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing **free energy**, a measure of disorder and surprise. Active inference, a corollary of the FEP, posits that the brain is not a passive recipient of sensory input but an active agent that seeks to predict and control its environment. This framework is not just a theoretical construct, but also a way of understanding the biological and psychological processes that underpin human behavior.

#### Project

Freud's early "Project for a Scientific Psychology," written in 1895, represents a fascinating, albeit ultimately abandoned, attempt to ground psychological theory in the neurophysiology of his time. Despite its limitations, this work anticipates many concepts now formalized within the frameworks of active inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). While Freud’s "Project" was limited by the available science of his era, its core ideas about energy flow, psychic conflict, and the brain’s drive to maintain a stable state resonate with the principles of active inference and the FEP, suggesting a profound, if indirect, alignment between early psychoanalytic thought and contemporary neuroscience. The FEP can be seen as a formalization and extension of Freud's early ideas, providing a neuroscientific framework for understanding the mechanisms of the mind.

**Freud viewed living things as dynamic energy systems, an idea deeply rooted in the physiology and thermodynamics of his time**. This perspective aligns with the FEP, which posits that all biological systems, including the brain, minimize free energy. According to the FEP, the brain functions as an open, adaptive, and complex system that is constantly attempting to reduce its free energy to resist a natural tendency towards disorder. The FEP describes the function of the mind-brain system as an adaptive biological system.

In the "Project," Freud introduced the concepts of "Bindung" (binding) and "Entbindung" (unbinding) to describe how energy is processed in the nervous system. He proposed that the nervous system's primary function was to discharge activation, but this was modified by an opposing secondary principle that delayed and modified the discharge. This concept is mirrored in the FEP, where the brain is viewed as an engine of prediction that seeks to minimize surprise and uncertainty by converting free energy into bound energy. Unbound energy, in this context, can be understood as a signal of prediction error, while bound energy is a representation that minimizes prediction error by fitting with the world.

Freud's distinction between primary and secondary processes also finds an interesting parallel within the FEP. Primary processes, associated with the id, are characterized by a free flow of energy and hallucinatory wish fulfillment. Secondary processes, linked to the ego, involve bound energy, language, and logic. This dual-process model is similar to the FEP's hierarchical model, in which lower levels of processing are more associated with prediction errors, while higher levels are associated with more stable and complex representations. In the FEP framework, lower levels of processing represent predictions about the external world, while higher levels represent predictions about our own internal states, or self-models.

**Freud also articulated that the purpose of the mental apparatus is to maintain a state of minimal excitation, which is consistent with the FEP, which suggests the brain’s objective is to minimize free energy and prediction error**. The FEP proposes that living systems act to minimize surprise, which is consistent with the notion that organisms try to maintain states within physiological bounds. The brain continuously adjusts its models of the world to minimize surprise by reducing prediction errors, therefore free energy is reduced as the brain's models are improved. **One of the most compelling aspects of the FEP is its potential to formalize and quantify concepts that Freud struggled with, such as psychic energy and conflict**. While Freud’s attempt to quantify conflict in terms of psychic energy encountered challenges, the FEP offers a way to quantify conflict as the free energy of competing policies. In this context, conflict arises when there is no clear winner amongst competing actions, and beliefs about what action to take have a low precision. Free energy is an information theoretic concept, not a physical energy, and can be mathematically analyzed to account for the dynamics of mental processes.

Freud’s "Project" was an attempt to ground psychology in the natural sciences, specifically in the physiology of the brain. Although he had to abandon this endeavor due to the limitations of his time, the FEP, with its basis in neurophysiology and information theory, aligns with Freud’s original vision of understanding the mind as a function of the brain. Freud's notion of "contact-barriers" in the "Project," which served as mechanisms for memory, bear a striking resemblance to the modern concept of synapses, which are the contact points between neurons. The alignment between Freud's "Project" and active inference/FEP is remarkable. While Freud's work was constrained by the scientific limitations of the 19th century, his core intuitions about the dynamic and energetic nature of the mind, its drive for stability, and the mechanisms of conflict and defense are echoed in the contemporary neuroscientific framework provided by active inference and the FEP. The FEP can be understood as a formal and quantifiable extension of Freud's early ideas, giving new life to some of his most challenging and enduring concepts.


#### Defense mechanisms

In psychoanalysis, defense mechanisms are understood as unconscious strategies employed by the ego to protect itself from distressing or conflicting thoughts and feelings. These mechanisms, such as repression, denial, and projection, operate by distorting or blocking awareness of unacceptable impulses or traumatic memories. From an FEP perspective, these mechanisms are not seen as dysfunctions but as adaptive processes that minimize surprise and maintain a stable model of the world by modifying the way the mind processes information. In this view, the brain is constantly predicting the causes of its sensations, and defense mechanisms are a way of altering predictions to reduce the experience of surprise or uncertainty. The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and defense mechanisms in psychoanalysis offers a compelling perspective on how the mind manages internal conflict and maintains stability. While traditional psychoanalytic theory describes defense mechanisms as primarily driven by the ego to avoid anxiety, the FEP provides a computational framework for understanding these processes as strategies to minimize prediction errors, resolve uncertainty, and maintain a coherent model of the world. **In essence, the FEP views defense mechanisms not merely as ways to avoid unpleasant feelings, but as active inferences aimed at reducing the brain's overall free energy.**


**Defense mechanisms are not static; they are learned and shaped by experience**. The FEP suggests that these mechanisms become entrenched over time as constraints on the future development of the generative model. In other words, if a particular defense mechanism has been successful at reducing prediction error, the brain is likely to rely on it again in similar situations. This can lead to rigid patterns of behavior and thought that are resistant to change, which can be seen as contributing to psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the brain can become trapped in a self-sustaining pattern of behavior if the priors associated with defensive responses become too entrenched.

Importantly, the FEP framework implies that defense mechanisms are not always maladaptive. In many cases, they may serve a necessary function of protecting the individual from overwhelming emotions or conflicts. However, when these mechanisms become too rigid or pervasive, they can limit a person's capacity for adaptation and growth. **Therapy, from this perspective, becomes a process of reducing the precision of these defensive responses to allow the individual to experience and integrate previously avoided feelings and thoughts**. In essence, the therapeutic process allows for a re-evaluation of previously suppressed representations by creating a safe environment where the client can explore and reduce the rigidity of their existing priors.

The alignment between active inference/FEP and defense mechanisms in psychoanalysis offers a new way of understanding how the mind manages conflict and maintains stability. The FEP provides a computational explanation for why defense mechanisms are used, and how they can become entrenched over time and also how they can be addressed in therapy. **By viewing defense mechanisms as active inferences aimed at minimizing prediction error, the FEP framework provides a bridge between the language of psychoanalysis and modern cognitive neuroscience**.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, repression is a defense mechanism in which a person unconsciously blocks unacceptable thoughts or memories from entering conscious awareness. In the FEP framework, this can be understood as a process of assigning low precision to the suppressed representation, making it less likely to be activated, thereby reducing the prediction error associated with that particular thought or memory. In a sense, the brain predicts that the suppressed memory should not enter consciousness, thereby minimizing the surprise that would occur if it did. Similarly, projection, in which a person attributes their own unacceptable feelings or impulses to others, could be seen as a way of reducing prediction error by aligning one’s own experience with an externalized version of the conflict. By attributing their feelings to others, a person avoids having to acknowledge their own internal conflict, minimizing the associated surprise.

The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and projective identification in psychoanalysis provides a framework for understanding how individuals shape their environments to fit their internal models. In psychoanalysis, **projective identification is a process where a person projects their own unwanted thoughts or feelings onto another person, who then unconsciously embodies those projections**. From an active inference perspective, this can be seen as an attempt to reduce prediction error by creating a world that confirms one's expectations.

Active inference suggests that the brain continuously attempts to minimize its free energy by either changing its internal models or influencing the external world. **Projective identification can be understood as a strategy where, instead of changing internal models, an individual manipulates their environment, particularly interpersonal relationships, to align with pre-existing beliefs**. For example, someone who anticipates being abandoned may unconsciously provoke others to leave them, thereby confirming their expectation.

From the FEP perspective, **projective identification is an entrenched "prior," inaccessible to updating via active inference**. Instead of revising priors in the light of experience, the individual attempts to shape the interpersonal world in the light of pre-existing phantasies. **In the therapeutic setting, projective identification can manifest in the relationship between therapist and client**. For example, a therapist might "forget" to inform a client about an upcoming break because they have been unconsciously induced by the client's expectation of abandonment. In this way, the therapist is not interpreting the meaning of the projective identification directly, but rather uses it as an opportunity to design experiments to help the client disambiguate their hypotheses about why they behave in the ways that they do.


#### Technique and Clinical considerations 


The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and clinical techniques in psychoanalysis, such as free association, transference, and the therapeutic alliance, offers a powerful framework for understanding how these methods facilitate psychological change. The FEP suggests that the brain is constantly working to minimize free energy, which can be understood as prediction error or surprise, and this principle can be applied to the therapeutic process.

**Free association**, a cornerstone of psychoanalytic technique, encourages patients to verbalize whatever comes to mind without censorship. From the perspective of active inference and the FEP, this process can be seen as a way to access and make explicit the implicit generative models that shape a person's experience. By temporarily suspending the usual top-down constraints on thought and speech, free association allows for a wider range of sensory and interoceptive information to enter awareness. This can bring to the surface previously unacknowledged patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving, including repressed memories and emotions. In essence, free association creates a space where the individual’s habitual predictions can be challenged and revised.

The FEP proposes that the brain minimizes prediction error by modifying its internal models of the world. Free association may help to bring to awareness implicit models which might be causing prediction errors, thereby allowing the client to adjust them. The chaotic and stochastic nature of free association can increase free energy, as it introduces a degree of disorder into the psyche. However, this increase in free energy is not necessarily detrimental; it can be a catalyst for change by making the usually hidden and implicit models more explicit. The therapeutic setting provides a safe and containing environment where the patient can explore these high-entropy states, thereby enabling the emergence of new insights. In this way, free association promotes psychic malleability and allows for the exploration of subjective experience in an original manner. **The therapist's role, in this process, is to attend to and reflect back the patterns and themes that emerge in free association, helping the client to make sense of their experience and construct new narratives**. 

**Transference**, another key concept in psychoanalysis, involves the patient unconsciously transferring relational patterns from past relationships onto the therapist. From the perspective of active inference, transference can be understood as the activation of entrenched priors about relationships. These priors, formed early in life, guide our expectations and behavior in interpersonal interactions. When these priors are activated in the therapeutic relationship, they provide an opportunity for the patient to explore and revise them. The therapist’s role is to recognize these transferential patterns and to help the patient become aware of how their past experiences are shaping their present interactions. The therapeutic relationship becomes a space for observing the client's typical patterns of relating, which may not be serving them well.

The FEP framework suggests that transference is a result of the brain trying to predict how people will behave based on previous experiences. When a person's experiences are not working in the present, this becomes a source of prediction error and free energy which the client will want to resolve. **By analyzing the transference, the therapist can help the client to become aware of their underlying models of relationships and to revise these models in a more adaptive direction**. In the therapeutic space, the therapist becomes an "enigmatic signifier" who embodies ambiguity, enabling the patient to experience, reconsider, and extend their top-down assumptions about relationships. The therapist does not interpret the meaning of the transference directly, but rather uses it as an opportunity to design experiments to help the client disambiguate their hypotheses about why they behave in the ways that they do.

**The therapeutic alliance, referring to the collaborative relationship between therapist and patient, is also seen as crucial for therapeutic success from an active inference/FEP perspective**. A strong therapeutic alliance is characterized by mutual trust, respect, and a shared understanding of the goals of therapy. Active inference suggests that effective communication is achieved through a process of aligning mental states, and a strong therapeutic alliance is an example of this. The therapist's ability to mentalize, which refers to the capacity to understand their own and others' mental states, plays a crucial role in the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance. When the therapist can accurately perceive and reflect the patient’s internal world, it helps the patient to feel understood, safe and that the therapist’s generative model is well-aligned to their own. This co-creation of shared meaning enhances the patient’s sense of agency, and creates the safety required to explore difficult emotional terrain.

**From the FEP viewpoint, the therapeutic alliance helps to reduce the client’s overall free energy by providing a predictable and safe environment for exploring previously avoided experiences**. The therapist’s non-partisan stance and capacity to contain difficult emotions helps the patient face trauma and conflict without becoming overwhelmed by psychic entropy. The secure base provided by the therapist allows the client to relax their epistemic vigilance and engage in a collaborative process of active inference, which allows the client to update their own generative model. Touch can also contribute to synchrony and the therapeutic alliance, with repetitive and affectionate touch offering important benefits.

Active inference also highlights the importance of communication in therapy. The therapeutic conversation is not simply a dialogue; it is a process of collaborative sense-making where both client and therapist engage in a shared process of reducing prediction error. **The therapist attempts to understand the client's unique way of seeing the world, and to use language that resonates with the client's "forms of feeling," which helps to enhance alignment and synchrony between their mental states**. The therapist’s use of language that is attuned to the client’s experience also signals the therapist’s attention to the client as a subjective, agentive self. Through this collaborative process, the client can develop a more accurate and flexible model of the world, and more flexible patterns of relating.

In conclusion, the alignment between active inference/FEP and psychoanalytic clinical techniques is not merely a theoretical exercise; it has important implications for how we understand and practice psychotherapy. By viewing free association, transference, and the therapeutic alliance through the lens of active inference and the FEP, we gain a deeper understanding of how these techniques facilitate psychological change. **The therapeutic process is ultimately a collaborative effort to minimize prediction errors, reduce free energy, and create a more integrated and adaptive model of the self and the world**. This perspective has the potential to bridge the gap between psychoanalytic theory and modern neuroscience, bringing the wisdom of psychoanalysis into dialogue with cutting-edge research on the brain and mind.

The alignment between active inference, the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and the psychoanalytic understanding of dreams reveals how dreams can be seen as a fundamental process for minimizing surprise and shaping our understanding of the world. Psychoanalysis considers dreams as a crucial pathway to the unconscious, and the FEP offers a complementary perspective by suggesting that dreams serve to refine our generative models and reduce free energy.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, **dreams are the "royal road to the unconscious"**, offering a glimpse into our hidden desires and traumatic experiences. Freud proposed that during sleep, the psychic energy is freer, leading to the expression of desires in a hallucinatory manner. The FEP echoes this by suggesting that dreams represent a state where the usual constraints on our generative models are relaxed, allowing for the exploration of different scenarios and the integration of new information.

The FEP suggests that **the brain is continuously attempting to minimize its free energy, which can be achieved by either changing the world or updating its internal models**. Dreams, in this context, can be understood as a form of "virtual reality" where the brain simulates possible future scenarios to prepare for potential challenges and reduce prediction error. By playing out these scenarios, the brain can refine its predictive models and reduce the likelihood of being surprised by future events.

**Dreams are also closely related to the concept of "reverie"**, which is considered a fundamental component of psychoanalytical therapies. According to one article, reverie is a state of empathic, containing attentional state and can offer practitioners a means to enter the predictive moment deeply, making use of its subtle contents to connect with clients. During the sessions, reverie appears as the state in which the patient enters. The therapist, too, enters a state that allows the therapist to dream the patient's experience and to "dream undreamt dreams". This state is catalyzed by the analyst's own dream function.

In terms of the dialogue between neuroscience and psychoanalysis, dreams and free association provide a clear path with cognitive science, free energy neuroscience, and computational psychiatry in order to create a consistent and solid connection between the psychological and neuroscientific views.

**The work of psychic integration occurs when coupled with secondary processes as a complementary system necessary for the reflexive metabolization of the subjective experience**, which requires a very particular psychic activity underlying the effects of free association, and is called the "alpha function".

According to one paper, **dreaming elaborates trauma so that it becomes thinkable**. This process involves a state of "letting go", which allows the emergence of simple and elegant solutions. **Psychoanalytical therapies catalyze these meaning and narrative processes, helping to regulate the psyche's energetic dynamics**.

One article states that from a FEP perspective, dreaming reworks trauma so that it becomes "thinkable".

**Traumatic experiences that induce too much entropy may not be integrated by the generative model of the brain and are cleaved from functioning**.

From the perspective of the FEP, **psychoanalytic therapies involve the transformation of the generative model with the idea that this will induce transformation of the subject’s relationship**. The main components of psychoanalytic therapies favor transformational processes, including specific processes like dreams.

The psychoanalytic approach considers that dreams express unconscious desires and traumatic experiences. The therapist pays attention to the patient's dreams and proposes interpretations about their meaning. **Dreams create a "virtual reality space" that allows for exploration of desires and traumatic experiences that have not been integrated**.

##### Desire
The alignment between active inference, the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and the concept of desire in psychoanalysis creates a framework for understanding motivation, affect, and the interactions between internal states and external actions. Within this synthesis, **desire is an active force, shaping perception, cognition, and behavior**, not a passive feeling.

Psychoanalysis understands the mind as a system influenced by unconscious desires and conflicts. Freud's work explored psychic energy and how mental processes reduce tension and seek pleasure. The FEP provides a lens to revisit these concepts with a quantifiable, information-theoretic approach to psychic energy.

Active inference, based on the FEP, suggests that organisms reduce free energy by inferring the causes of sensations. This minimization involves:
*   **Action:** Changing the external world to match internal expectations.
*   **Perception:** Updating internal models to better predict sensory input.

Desire drives both action and perception, guiding the organism toward predictable states.

One way to view **desire is through a linguistic model, where individuals are signifiers in a chain of meaning**. Desire drives individuals to seek the signified object, creating an interplay between subjects. Complexity theory suggests this is a process of partial synchronization where individuals influence internal states.

Affect is key in active inference, serving as an intrinsic motivator. **Free energy is aversive, like mental pain, while reducing it is rewarding**, so positive and negative affects drive the organism to minimize free energy, shaping behavior.

**Expected free energy** formally describes action selection, where the likelihood of choosing an action decreases with the expected free energy. An organism experiencing thirst seeks water because that action is predicted to result in the lowest expected free energy, aligning with the psychoanalytic idea that gratifying an instinct reduces free energy.

Some researchers note the role of **"first priors,"** prioritized predictions related to the body's internal states and the organism's lifestyle. These underpin habits, skills, and social/cultural norms, shaping sense-making.

Motivation and desire are the divergence between an individual's current state and their anticipated future state achieved through action. Expected prediction errors, which quantify the difference between expected and preferred outcomes, drive individuals to reduce this divergence.

**The environment is experienced through desire, presenting "inviting affordances."** Desire drives improving one's "grip" on these affordances, guiding action and shaping interaction with the world.

Psychoanalysis emphasizes unconscious processes, while the FEP highlights the brain's hierarchical organization. The default mode network (DMN) mediates between primary and secondary processes, integrating internal and external information. This integration is essential for symbolization, transforming sensations and emotions into thinkable contents.

**Psychotherapeutic procedures enhance interpersonal satisfaction and challenge self-fulfilling priors**. Therapy creates a supportive environment to explore unconscious desires and revise maladaptive beliefs.

The FEP integrates subcortical emotions with cortical predictive models. The mind maintains homeostasis, and predictions are motivated by desires and wishes, supporting the idea that "all thinking is wishful-thinking".

Within active inference, **desire links to action and exploration**. Active inference is enhanced by seeking help and collaboration, a process where individuals refine their understanding of the world. Blocked explorations to reduce free energy may be responsible for psychological illness. Psychoanalysis evokes and then quiets trauma-related unbound energy through free association, dream analysis, and transference analysis.

Synthesizing active inference, the FEP, and psychoanalytic concepts, the relationship between desire, affect, and subjective experience can be appreciated. This interdisciplinary approach provides a framework for understanding the human mind and offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

________

The FEP thus offers a potentially unifying framework for understanding a wide array of psychological processes, spanning from perception and attention to action. Crucially, it provides a bridge between mind and brain, allowing for a formalization of psychoanalytic concepts within a neuroscientific framework. The integration of the FEP and active inference allows psychoanalysis to gain a robust scientific grounding, while psychoanalysis offers valuable insights into the psychotherapeutic process. Future research could investigate how the therapeutic relationship influences free energy computations, and how computational models of active inference could simulate psychotherapeutic processes and validate existing hypotheses. Though the FEP has immense power as a framework for understanding the mind, there are also limits to the epistemological approach to psychic states. Some aspects of the unconscious as it emerges in the free associative process might remain inaccessible to direct representation, and more work is needed in order to determine how to best integrate the subjective experience of the therapeutic process with formal models of the mind.

In conclusion, the relationship between the FEP, active inference, and psychoanalysis represents a promising avenue for integrating the theoretical depth of psychoanalysis with the scientific rigor of computational neuroscience. The FEP provides a unique lens through which to understand diverse psychological functions, the processes underlying psychotherapeutic change, and the complex interplay between the brain and the mind.
________________________

Psychoanalysis, with its focus on the unconscious mind, and neuroscience, which seeks to understand the biological functions of the brain, have historically been seen as separate disciplines. However, the **free energy principle (FEP)** has emerged as a unifying framework that bridges the gap between these fields. The FEP, developed by Karl Friston, posits that all living organisms, including humans, are driven to minimize their free energy, a measure of surprise or uncertainty about their environment. This minimization is achieved through perception, action, and learning, aligning internal models of the world with sensory inputs.

**Active inference**, a related concept, suggests that the brain is not a passive recipient of sensory information but actively infers the causes of its sensations by generating predictions and comparing them to incoming sensory data. Prediction errors, the discrepancies between predictions and sensations, are then used to update internal models and refine future predictions. This continuous cycle of prediction and error correction allows organisms to maintain homeostasis and navigate their environment effectively.

Within this framework, psychoanalytic concepts such as conflict, defense, and the unconscious can be reinterpreted in terms of the brain's mechanisms for minimizing free energy. This essay will explore the neurobiological substrates of these psychoanalytic concepts within the active inference and free energy minimization framework.

### Conflict and Free Energy

Psychoanalytic theory posits that **conflict** arises when incompatible drives, wishes, or beliefs compete for expression. This internal struggle can lead to anxiety, distress, and psychological symptoms. From the perspective of the FEP, conflict can be understood as a state of high free energy, where the brain is uncertain about which course of action to take.

According to Connolly, the FEP suggests that a person's decision about which policy of action to follow is determined by a computation of which policy is predicted to reduce the physiological free energy the most. Psychoanalytic conflict is presented as the state where different potential policies of action have a similar level of expected free energy, creating a subjectively unpleasant state of uncertainty of what to do.

Berlin and Montgomery reviewed the existing literature on neurophysiological correlates of conflict in the psychoanalytic sense. While their chapter draws together a number of interesting studies with findings that seem to have implications for conflict, few of these studies focus explicitly on conflict itself and its key neural mechanism; many of the findings relevant to conflict from this literature are more specifically about repression, suppression and dissociation, though some do have clear implications for conflict.

### Defense Mechanisms and Precision Weighting

To reduce this uncertainty and minimize free energy, the brain employs **defense mechanisms**, which are unconscious strategies that distort reality, exclude unacceptable impulses from awareness, or prevent the expression of conflicting desires. These mechanisms, such as repression, denial, and projection, can be seen as ways of altering the precision or confidence assigned to different beliefs or predictions.

From a statistical FEP perspective, conflict is resolved by alteration of the relative precisions of the beliefs about opposing action policies. This alteration of precisions presents a means of formalizing defense, which becomes entrenched over time as a constraint on the future development of the generative model.

For example, **repression**, the unconscious exclusion of disturbing thoughts or feelings from awareness, can be interpreted as a reduction in the precision of sensory information related to those thoughts or feelings. By diminishing the salience or reliability of these inputs, the brain can minimize prediction errors and maintain a stable internal model. Similarly, **projection**, the attribution of one's own unacceptable impulses to others, can be seen as an increase in the precision of predictions about others' behavior, based on one's own internal states.

### The Unconscious and Implicit Processes

The **unconscious**, a central concept in psychoanalytic theory, refers to the mental processes that occur outside of conscious awareness. These processes, which include repressed desires, implicit memories, and automatic behaviors, exert a powerful influence on our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Within the active inference framework, the unconscious can be understood as the set of implicit generative models that shape our perceptions and actions without our conscious awareness. These models, which are constantly updated based on past experiences, generate predictions about the world and guide our behavior in ways that minimize free energy.

Brouillet proposes to explore the non-conscious component of the experience of memory. More specifically, on the basis of both empirical data concerning the role of the presence of a discrepancy in ongoing processing and on theoretical arguments from active inference.

According to Carhart-Harris and Friston, Freud's hierarchical organization of the mind, with its distinction between id and ego can be enhanced by consistency with contemporary models of cognition based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and Helmholtzian free energy. Freudian metapsychology distinguished two ways of mental functioning, the primary and the secondary processes, corresponding to the pleasure and reality principle, respectively. The primary process is driven by the pleasure principle, which is in turn driven by the id and its instinctual functioning with its instincts and desires, without taking into account the constraints of the external environment with its rules and laws. The secondary process, also called the reality principle, is governed by the ego, which controls the instant gratification mentality of the id. The reality principle is the ability of the mind to assess the reality of external world and to act accordingly with it, as opposed to the pleasure principle.

### Therapeutic Implications

The active inference model of coherence therapy attempts to leverage the explanatory power of the Free Energy Principle by offering critical analysis of an empirically validated post-Freudian psychotherapy through the lens of Bayes Optimal Pathology. Application of Bayes Optimal Pathology presents two key questions for computational neuropsychology. The first question is “what are the prior beliefs that would have to be held to make this behavior optimal?”. Next, having identified the (putative) suboptimal priors, the question becomes “what are the biological substrates of these priors”?. Or, what happens in the brain?. These questions can be considered an exercise in Psychodynamic Neuroscience, in essence, using the Free Energy Principle as a bridge between mind and brain.

Psychoanalytic psychotherapies require a setting (made up of several envelopes), a particular psychic state and specific processes (transference, free association, dreaming, play, reflexivity and narrativity) in order to induce psychic transformations. Psychoanalytic therapies involve the transformation of the generative model with the idea that this will induce transformation of the subject’s relationship.

Rabeyron examines the role of free association from the point of view of psychoanalysis and neuroscience in order to improve the understanding of therapeutic effects induced by psychoanalytic therapies and psychoanalysis. In this regard, he proposes a global overview of the historical origins of the concept of free association in psychoanalysis and examines how Freud established its principles. Then, from Freud’s distinction between primary and secondary processes, he proceeds to compare the psychoanalytic model with research originating from cognitive psychology and neuroscience. The notions of entropy and free energy appear particularly relevant at the intersection of these different domains. Finally, he proposes the notion of symbolizing transmodality to describe certain specificities of symbolization processes within free association and summarizes the main functions of free association in psychoanalytic practices.

Holmes and Nolte note that the development of the generative model occurs through the “borrowing” of the maternal brain and suggest that “this borrowed brain model introduces a vital interpersonal dimension to the Bayesian process”. The baby thus internalizes the experience of maternal care in order to reduce the entropy: “these embodied gestures present a model of the infant from the caregiver’s perspective helping the child to integrate primary sensory signals into regularities of emotional and interpersonal consequences”. Within psychodynamic therapies, a similar process emerges as the subject develops its capacity for psychic integration through the intersubjective relationship with the therapist.

The therapeutic alliance can therefore be seen as a process of co-regulation, where the therapist helps the patient to explore and revise their internal models, reduce prediction errors, and minimize free energy. The therapist's empathy, understanding, and non-judgmental stance create a safe and supportive environment in which the patient can confront difficult emotions, challenge maladaptive beliefs, and develop more flexible and adaptive ways of relating to themselves and others.

### Conclusion

The **active inference and free energy minimization framework provides a powerful lens through which to understand the neurobiological substrates of psychoanalytic concepts**. By reinterpreting conflict, defense, the unconscious, and therapeutic action in terms of the brain's mechanisms for minimizing free energy, this framework offers a bridge between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. This integration has the potential to advance our understanding of the mind, inform the development of more effective treatments for mental disorders, and promote a more holistic and integrated approach to mental health care.
