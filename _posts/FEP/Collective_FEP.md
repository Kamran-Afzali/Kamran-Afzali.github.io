### Main points

The main points of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization are:

*   **Collective motion** Macroscopic patterns can arise from decentralized, local interactions, and can be modeled using active inference. This approach suggests that collective behavior results from individual agents minimizing surprise, without needing explicit behavioral rules or goals.
*   **Active inference** blends cognitivist and physics-based approaches by suggesting that behavior is governed by the minimization of surprise or prediction error.
*   **Collective intelligence** can be understood as a system that is able to minimize free energy or perform approximate Bayesian inference at a collective level.
*   **Shared generative model** By equipping agents with a shared generative model of a shared world, Bayesian belief updating can be distributed over multiple agents. This requires a common ground or frame of reference, with conserved belief structures and representations across agents.

The structure of language inherits the structure of the underlying generative model and is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world.
*   **Multi-scale application** Active inference can be applied across scales, with collectives of active inference agents maintaining a group-level Markov blanket and acting as a larger group-level active inference agent with its own generative model.
*   **System-level free energy** Collective performance can be measured using system-level free energy, where lower free energy indicates higher system performance. Cognitive sophistication at the individual level is associated with reductions in free energy at the system level.

### Shared generative model

In collective behavior, **macroscopic patterns emerge from decentralized, local interactions**, showcasing a range of behaviors from directed movement to disordered swarming. Modeling these phenomena through active inference offers a unique perspective, casting behavior as a consequence of individual agents minimizing surprise. This approach contrasts with traditional models that depict individuals as self-propelled particles subject to social forces. Instead, active inference treats organisms as probabilistic decision-makers, suggesting that collective behaviors arise naturally from active Bayesian inference, **without explicitly programming behavioral rules or goals into individual agents**.

Active inference integrates the construct validity of cognitivist approaches with the elegance of physics-based models by employing a single, all-encompassing objective function: surprise, or prediction error. **This framework posits that agents estimate distances to neighbors and adjust their actions to minimize deviations from expected distances**, effectively recovering social forces as gradients of free energy.

**Collective intelligence**, viewed through the lens of active inference, is understood as a system's capacity to minimize free energy or perform approximate Bayesian inference at a collective level. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual interactions in producing intelligent collective behavior that transcends individual capabilities.

A cornerstone of collective active inference is the **shared generative model**, wherein agents possess a common understanding of their shared world, enabling distributed Bayesian belief updating. This necessitates a common frame of reference, with belief structures and representations conserved across agents. The shared generative model allows agents to inherit and assimilate each other's perspectives, enhancing their ability to navigate and make sense of their environment.

**Federated inference and learning emerge from minimizing variational, expected, and reduced free energy**, providing a first-principles account of state inference, parameter learning, and model selection for any generative model and implicit agent. This framework supports the idea that agents in a collective can learn and adapt more effectively by sharing information and aligning their internal models.

**Belief-sharing plays a crucial role in resolving uncertainty about hidden states**, particularly when observable consequences are only visible to one agent at a time. By communicating their beliefs, agents can collectively build a more complete and accurate representation of their environment, reducing uncertainty and improving decision-making. Communication, in this context, involves not only the content of beliefs but also the confidence with which they are held.

**Linguistic communication emerges as agents broadcast their beliefs, increasing the accuracy of their world models and enhancing communication efficiency**. As agents interact and exchange information, they collectively refine their understanding of the world, leading to the emergence of shared meanings and conventions. The structure of language reflects the structure of the underlying generative model and is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world.

Active inference can be applied across multiple scales, with collectives of active inference agents maintaining a group-level Markov blanket and acting as a larger group-level active inference agent with its own generative model. This multi-scale application highlights the potential for nested hierarchies of active inference processes, where individual agents contribute to the behavior of larger collectives, which in turn influence the behavior of even larger systems.

**System-level free energy measures collective performance**, with lower free energy indicating higher system performance. Cognitive sophistication at the individual level is associated with reductions in free energy at the system level. This suggests that enhancing the cognitive abilities of individual agents can lead to improvements in the overall performance of the collective.

Constraints naturally arise from free energy minimization, influencing language and communication. These constraints, derived from the generative model, shape the structure of language and the ways in which agents interact and exchange information. The free energy principle is dual to the constrained maximum entropy principle, where the constraints inherit from the generative model.

As free energy is minimized, complexity emerges, with increased accuracy in understanding the environment leading to increased complexity. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment.

Active inference offers explanations of how an agent resists a natural tendency to entropy. By minimizing free energy, agents maintain their integrity and stability in the face of environmental fluctuations and challenges. Through prediction error minimization and temporally extended planning, agents proactively shape their environment to align with their expectations and goals.

Within the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization, **the concept of a shared generative model is essential for understanding how individual agents coordinate and interact to produce coherent collective behavior.** This shared model serves as a common ground, enabling agents to interpret each other's actions, anticipate future events, and make decisions that align with the goals of the group.

The shared generative model encompasses not only beliefs about the environment but also expectations about the behavior of other agents. This allows agents to engage in social interactions, cooperate towards common objectives, and adapt to changing social dynamics. The shared model also facilitates the transmission of knowledge and skills across generations, contributing to the accumulation of culture and the evolution of social norms.

However, challenges remain in fully understanding the emergence and dynamics of shared generative models. One key question is how agents initially develop these shared models and how they are updated and refined over time through interaction and learning. Another challenge is to elucidate the relationship between individual and collective goals and how agents balance their own interests with the needs of the group.

Despite these challenges, the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization offers a promising approach to understanding the complexities of collective behavior. By combining insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and information theory, this framework provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing a wide range of phenomena, from animal social behavior to human cultural dynamics.

The implications of this framework extend beyond theoretical understanding. By providing a formal and quantitative account of collective intelligence, active inference can inform the design of artificial intelligence systems that are capable of collaborating and coordinating effectively in complex environments. Moreover, insights from active inference can be applied to improve organizational decision-making, enhance team performance, and foster more resilient and adaptive social systems.

In conclusion, the shared generative model is a central concept in the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization. It provides a foundation for understanding how individual agents coordinate and interact to produce coherent collective behavior, learn from their environment, and adapt to changing circumstances. By continuing to explore the emergence and dynamics of shared generative models, researchers can gain valuable insights into the nature of collective intelligence and its potential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.

##### Collective intelligence


Collective intelligence, as an emergent phenomenon, describes a system where interacting agents achieve performance levels exceeding the sum of their individual capabilities. Within the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization, this intelligence arises from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. This essay explores how collective intelligence emerges within this framework, emphasizing the importance of shared generative models, belief sharing, and the multi-scale nature of active inference.

At the heart of collective active inference lies the principle that **agents, whether individuals or collectives, are fundamentally driven to minimize their variational free energy**. Variational free energy can be understood as the difference between the sensory data registered by the system and the data expected under some model of how the data were generated. This minimization imperative leads agents to actively engage with their environment, make predictions, and update their internal models based on incoming sensory information. In a collective setting, this process is not confined to individual agents but extends to the group level, where the collective itself acts as a higher-order agent striving to minimize its overall free energy.

A cornerstone of collective intelligence within this framework is the **shared generative model**. The shared generative model encompasses not only beliefs about the environment but also expectations about the behavior of other agents. This allows agents to engage in social interactions, cooperate towards common objectives, and adapt to changing social dynamics. **This shared model serves as a common ground, enabling agents to interpret each other's actions, anticipate future events, and make decisions that align with the goals of the group**. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation. The shared model also facilitates the transmission of knowledge and skills across generations, contributing to the accumulation of culture and the evolution of social norms. It's through communication via broadcasting beliefs that agents can increase the accuracy of their world models and enhance communication efficiency.

**Belief sharing** is another critical component of collective intelligence. Agents communicate their beliefs about the environment and the actions of other agents. By sharing beliefs, agents can collectively reduce uncertainty and improve their understanding of the world. This is particularly important when individual agents have limited or incomplete information. Belief-sharing appears to be a fundamental aspect of realizing joint free energy minimization, distributed over ensembles of free energy minimizing processes and over the timescales at which these processes unfold. Belief sharing is most effective when agents communicate full belief distributions rather than limiting belief-sharing to a noisy gradient estimate.

Active inference operates across multiple scales. Individual agents form collectives, which in turn can form larger-scale systems. **Collectives of active inference agents can maintain a group-level Markov blanket**, effectively acting as a larger group-level agent with its own generative model. This multi-scale perspective allows us to understand how individual actions contribute to collective behavior and how collective-level dynamics influence individual agents.

Within the collective active inference framework, several cognitive mechanisms facilitate the emergence of collective intelligence. **Theory of Mind**, the ability to understand that other agents have their own beliefs and intentions, allows agents to better predict the behavior of others and coordinate their actions. **Goal alignment**, the degree to which agents share common objectives, promotes cooperation and reduces conflict within the collective. **Communication**, the exchange of information between agents, enables the sharing of beliefs and the coordination of actions. It has been found that shared goals have a natural connection with the global optimum states, meaning that shared goals emerge endogenously from the agents’ interaction with their social environment.

System-level free energy serves as a measure of collective performance. Lower free energy indicates higher system performance, reflecting the collective's ability to accurately predict and control its environment. Cognitive sophistication at the individual level is associated with reductions in free energy at the system level, suggesting that enhancing the cognitive abilities of individual agents can lead to improvements in the overall performance of the collective.

Constraints play a crucial role in shaping collective behavior within the active inference framework. These constraints, derived from the generative model, influence language, communication, and the ways in which agents interact and exchange information. As agents minimize free energy, they adapt to these constraints, leading to the emergence of stable patterns of behavior and communication.

As free energy is minimized, complexity emerges within the collective. Increased accuracy in understanding the environment leads to increased complexity, reflecting the collective's ability to represent and process information about its surroundings. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment.

Active inference provides explanations of how agents resist a natural tendency to entropy. By minimizing free energy, agents maintain their integrity and stability in the face of environmental fluctuations and challenges. Through prediction error minimization and temporally extended planning, agents proactively shape their environment to align with their expectations and goals.

Active inference can inform the design of artificial intelligence systems capable of collaborating and coordinating effectively in complex environments. Moreover, insights from active inference can be applied to improve organizational decision-making, enhance team performance, and foster more resilient and adaptive social systems.

Collective intelligence within the collective active inference framework emerges from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. The shared generative model, belief sharing, multi-scale organization, and cognitive mechanisms such as Theory of Mind and goal alignment all contribute to this emergent intelligence. By continuing to explore these concepts, we can gain valuable insights into the nature of collective behavior and its potential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.

**Federated inference and learning** represent a sophisticated approach to distributed cognition, enabling agents to collaboratively enhance their understanding of a shared world. Within the frameworks of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, federated inference and learning emerge as natural consequences of agents striving to minimize surprise and maximize model evidence. This essay explores the principles and mechanisms underlying federated inference and learning, emphasizing the roles of shared generative models, belief sharing, active learning, and the emergence of complexity in multi-agent systems.

At its core, federated inference and learning relies on the concept that multiple agents, each with their own perspective and sensory experiences, can collectively infer the hidden states of a shared environment more effectively than any single agent acting alone. This is achieved through the **sharing of posterior beliefs**, which allows agents to integrate information from diverse sources and refine their internal models of the world.

**Active inference** provides a unifying framework for understanding how agents engage in inference, learning, and decision-making. Under the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**, agents are viewed as self-organizing systems that minimize their variational free energy, a measure of the difference between their predictions and sensory observations. This minimization imperative drives agents to actively explore their environment, make predictions about future states, and update their internal models based on incoming sensory information.

In a federated setting, agents not only minimize their individual free energy but also contribute to the minimization of a **joint free energy** at the group level. This requires agents to share their beliefs and coordinate their actions in a way that maximizes the overall coherence and predictability of the system. The sharing of beliefs can be understood as a form of communication, where agents broadcast their internal states to other members of the group.

**A shared generative model** is crucial for enabling effective communication and belief sharing among agents. The generative model encodes an agent's beliefs about the causal structure of the world, including the relationships between hidden states, observations, and actions. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation.

**Active learning** plays a central role in federated inference and learning by enabling agents to refine their generative models through experience. Agents actively seek out informative observations that reduce their uncertainty about the world and improve the accuracy of their predictions. In a multi-agent setting, active learning can be enhanced through social interaction, where agents learn from each other's experiences and adapt their models based on the collective evidence.

**Belief sharing** is fundamental to realizing joint free energy minimization, distributed over ensembles of free energy minimizing processes and over the timescales at which these processes unfold. Belief sharing is most effective when agents communicate full belief distributions rather than limiting belief-sharing to a noisy gradient estimate.

As agents engage in federated inference and learning, they not only improve their individual performance but also contribute to the emergence of **collective intelligence** at the group level. Collective intelligence refers to the ability of a group to solve complex problems and make decisions that exceed the capabilities of any single member. Within the active inference framework, collective intelligence emerges from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world.

**Constraints** play a crucial role in shaping collective behavior within the active inference framework. These constraints, derived from the generative model, influence language, communication, and the ways in which agents interact and exchange information. As agents minimize free energy, they adapt to these constraints, leading to the emergence of stable patterns of behavior and communication.

As free energy is minimized, **complexity** emerges within the collective. Increased accuracy in understanding the environment leads to increased complexity, reflecting the collective's ability to represent and process information about its surroundings. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment.

The mechanisms underlying federated inference and learning have implications for a wide range of applications, including:

*   **Distributed sensing and surveillance:** Multiple sensors can collaborate to monitor a shared environment, combining their observations to detect anomalies and track objects of interest.
*   **Collaborative robotics:** Teams of robots can coordinate their actions to perform complex tasks, such as search and rescue operations or assembly line manufacturing.
*   **Social learning and cultural transmission:** Individuals can learn from each other's experiences and transmit knowledge and skills across generations, leading to the accumulation of culture and the evolution of social norms.
*   **Organizational decision-making:** Teams of decision-makers can share their perspectives and expertise to make more informed and effective choices.

Active learning and selection complement each other. In active learning, posterior parameters change to minimize variational free energy if, and only if, expected free energy is reduced. Conversely, in active selection, prior parameters change to minimize expected free energy if, and only if, variational free energy is reduced as scored with Bayesian model reduction. The implicit bootstrapping underwrites self-evidencing towards precise and predictable exchanges.

In summary, federated inference and learning offer a powerful approach to distributed cognition, enabling agents to collectively enhance their understanding of a shared world. By leveraging the principles of active inference, shared generative models, belief sharing, and active learning, agents can achieve levels of performance that exceed their individual capabilities and contribute to the emergence of collective intelligence at the group level. The mechanisms described in this essay have implications for a wide range of applications, from distributed sensing and robotics to social learning and organizational decision-making. By continuing to explore these concepts, we can gain valuable insights into the nature of collective behavior and its potential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.

### Language and communication

**Language and communication** are critical components of collective behavior, serving as the bridge that connects individual agents within a group and enables the emergence of coordinated, intelligent action. Within the framework of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, language and communication are not merely tools for exchanging information but are fundamental processes that shape the very fabric of social interaction and cultural evolution. This essay explores the intricate relationship between language, communication, and collective intelligence, emphasizing how these phenomena arise from the basic principles of **active inference** and **free energy minimization**.

At its core, the **active inference framework** posits that all living systems, from individual organisms to entire societies, are driven by a fundamental imperative to minimize their **variational free energy**. **Variational free energy** can be understood as a measure of surprise or uncertainty about the world. To minimize this surprise, agents must build internal models of their environment and use these models to predict future sensory inputs. When predictions match reality, free energy is low, and the agent is in a state of equilibrium. However, when predictions fail, free energy increases, prompting the agent to update its model or take actions to change the environment in a way that reduces surprise.

In a social context, **language and communication** play a crucial role in minimizing free energy by enabling agents to share their internal models and coordinate their actions. When agents can communicate effectively, they can pool their knowledge, correct each other's errors, and make more accurate predictions about the world. This leads to a reduction in overall uncertainty and a more robust, adaptive collective.

**Communication** is often framed as a process of reducing uncertainty about the world, drawing conversation partners closer through intersubjective reference frames. This perspective casts communication as a means of **mutual attunement**, wherein agents actively infer each other's internal belief states and update their own representations accordingly. The natural result of this bidirectional inference is the synchronization of belief states within the cultural ensemble.

One key element in this framework is the concept of a **shared generative model**. A generative model is an internal representation of the world that allows agents to make predictions about their sensory experiences. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation.

The creation and use of language can be seen as a process of **scientific niche construction (SNC)**, wherein the environment is modified to influence expectations and drive actions aimed at confirming hypotheses. In this view, models guide the collection of new evidence, and new evidence refines the models, creating an ongoing cycle of hypothesis generation, evidence collection, and hypothesis revision that drives scientific progress.

From the perspective of **active inference**, agents of a socio-cultural system infer the belief states of those in their environment and update their own representations accordingly. An emergent property of this bi-directional inference is the synchronization of belief states among the cultural ensemble. This synchronization relies on the notion of **generalized synchrony** as signaling the emergence of a shared narrative to which all parties refer.

The complexity of language allows humans to convey not only the content of beliefs but also the **confidence** in those beliefs. Communication in this sense is more than just the transmission of information; it includes the nuances and subtleties that allow for a deeper understanding between individuals. This deeper exchange can lead to the emergence of shared expectations and narratives that reduce free energy.

Moreover, **cultural transmission** occurs not only through explicit communication but also through implicit learning, where agents infer others' expectations through immersive participation in cultural practices. This implicit learning shapes attention and behavior, allowing individuals to learn social behaviors and expectations within their culture.

**Federated learning** fits into this framework by suggesting that agents sharing the same beliefs about the sensory consequences of an action will be able to figure out their roles in a larger pattern. This is made possible through **communication** premised on a shared generative model. In this view, science itself can be seen as a high-level ensemble of Markov blanketed systems, an emergent system that both constrains and is constrained by the behavior of its constituent parts.

However, **efficient communication** is not without its challenges. The environment itself does not impose the practical constraints that drive real-life human behaviors. The model can be expanded to include practical constraints and real-world dynamics to address these issues. Furthermore, indirect information sharing can introduce the risk of amplifying noisy or irrelevant information, leading to maladaptive group outcomes.

The dynamics of **cultural evolution** are closely tied to communication. Through dialogue, individual mental models are modified, and distinct representations converge to a shared narrative. This attunement of interlocutors translates over time into collective free energy minimization.

Communication relies on agents having precise **likelihood mappings**, and agents acquire these mappings because they expect to acquire them. When agents are devoid of language capabilities, they can still develop language mappings through interaction and exposure. The convergence to a common ground or frame of reference is mediated by free energy selection processes at the level of the model structure, using Bayesian model reduction.

From a psychological perspective, the **desire to share** encourages the emergence of language, which in turn enlarges common ground and makes models of the world more accurate. This creates a mental niche in which communication is more efficient, and the ability to share is enhanced, all driven by free energy minimization.

**Constraints and Universal Grammar**:
From a linguistic standpoint, the constraints that shape language arise naturally from free energy minimization. If language is the broadcasting of beliefs under a generative model, then the structure of language should inherit the factorial structure of the underlying generative model, which is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world.

**Active Inference and Communication Difficulties**:
In cases where divergent beliefs exist, communication can become intractable. In such situations, communicative isolation between incongruent groups may emerge as a strategy to minimize expected free energy.

In summary, **language and communication** are central to the emergence of collective intelligence within the **active inference framework**. By enabling agents to share their internal models, coordinate their actions, and learn from each other's experiences, language and communication facilitate the minimization of free energy at both the individual and collective levels. As agents engage in these processes, they contribute to the creation of shared knowledge, the evolution of cultural norms, and the ability of collectives to solve complex problems and adapt to changing environments. Further research into the dynamics of language and communication within active inference promises to yield valuable insights into the nature of social behavior and the potential for creating more intelligent, cooperative, and resilient societies.
