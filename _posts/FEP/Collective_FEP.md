### **Collective Active Inference and Group-Level Free Energy Minimization**

The free energy principle (FEP) has emerged as a fundamental framework for understanding cognition, perception, and action across biological and artificial systems. At its core, active inference—a process derived from FEP—suggests that organisms act to minimize surprise or uncertainty by constantly updating their beliefs and engaging in goal-directed behavior. While this framework has been extensively explored in individual agents, recent research has extended active inference to collective behavior, proposing that groups, societies, and even cultures operate under the same principles of free energy minimization. This essay explores how collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization function as mechanisms for social adaptation, decision-making, and coordinated action in multi-agent systems. One crucial aspect of group-level free energy minimization is the concept of Markov blankets, which define the boundaries between an agent and its environment. At the social level, Markov blankets extend to delineate group structures, demarcating subgroups and social roles. Kirchhoff et al. (2018) argue that social Markov blankets function to maintain coherence in collective behavior by constraining information flow within and between groups. These boundaries enable modularity in collective cognition, ensuring that subgroups can specialize while still contributing to the overall functioning of the collective.

Active inference at the individual level involves a dynamic interplay between perception and action. An agent forms probabilistic models of the environment and acts to reduce discrepancies between its predictions and sensory inputs. This process is iterative, with continuous updating of internal models to minimize free energy. When applied to groups, active inference extends beyond the individual, encompassing shared generative models that facilitate coordinated action, cooperation, and even cultural evolution.

Collective active inference operates on the principle that individuals within a group do not merely act as isolated agents but participate in a distributed cognitive system. This distributed cognition enables coordinated decision-making, wherein agents share and update beliefs based on collective experiences. Heins and Ramstead (2022) propose that collective behavior arises from surprise minimization across interconnected individuals, meaning that social interactions serve to reduce uncertainty at both individual and group levels. Through federated inference and belief sharing (Friston et al., 2024), groups establish common priors and predictive models, ensuring coherence in collective actions.

A main part of the collective active inference framework  is the concept of a **shared generative model**. By equipping agents with a shared generative model of a shared world, Bayesian belief updating can be distributed across multiple agents. This distribution relies on a **common ground or frame of reference**, ensuring conserved belief structures and representations across agents. For agents to effectively share beliefs, there must be an isomorphism between their beliefs, requiring generative models with conserved belief structures. Within this context **Federated inference and learning** emerges as a concept reffering to minimizing variational, expected, and reduced free energy, offering a first-principles account of state inference, parameter learning, and model selection for any generative model and implicit agent. **Belief-sharing** plays a crucial role in resolving uncertainty about hidden states, especially when observable consequences are only visible to one agent at a time. By sharing beliefs, agents can accumulate evidence through multiple perspectives, enhancing the efficiency of belief updating. This process relies on a shared generative model, where the mapping between each agent's beliefs and expressions is conserved across agents. In scenarios where agents have complementary perspectives, communication resolves uncertainty about latent states in their shared world. Communication is a vital component of collective active inference, serving as a mechanism for synchronizing beliefs across individuals. Heyes (2018) argues that human communication itself can be understood as an active inference process, wherein interlocutors minimize uncertainty by exchanging signals that refine their shared generative models. This perspective aligns with the notion of federated inference (Friston et al., 2024), where distributed agents update their beliefs based on shared information, thereby reducing global free energy. **Linguistic communication emerges** as agents broadcast beliefs, increasing the accuracy of their world models and enhancing communication efficiency. As agents interact and share information, they develop a shared language that facilitates coordination and knowledge sharing. The structure of language inherits the structure of the underlying generative model and is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world. This perspective aligns with linguistic theories such as Universal Grammar and Optimality Theory, where constraints arise naturally from free energy minimization. 

Cumulative culture, as explored by Kastel et al. (2022), provides an example of group-level active inference in action. Culture can be seen as a form of distributed generative modeling where individuals collectively refine and transmit knowledge across generations. The emergence of cumulative culture relies on joint active inference, whereby individuals align their internal models through social learning and communication. This alignment allows for the progressive accumulation of innovations, facilitating the evolution of complex social structures and technologies. Within this context social norms and institutions can also be understood as emergent properties of group-level free energy minimization. Buskell (2020) emphasizes that normativity and social change are deeply tied to epistemic framing within a community. Norms function as shared priors that guide behavior and reduce uncertainty in social interactions. When these priors become misaligned with environmental changes, collective active inference enables their adaptation or replacement. This adaptive process ensures that social structures remain functional and resilient in the face of evolving challenges.

A significant challenge in collective active inference is the balance between individual autonomy and group-level coherence. On one hand, individuals must maintain their own predictive models to navigate personal uncertainties. On the other, they must integrate their models with those of the collective to achieve coordinated action. This tension is evident in multi-agent decision-making scenarios, such as those modeled by Levchuk et al. (2018), where agents must dynamically adapt their strategies based on context-driven collaboration. Decentralized decision-making in multi-agent systems exemplifies how active inference can scale to complex social interactions without requiring a centralized controller. Likewise, Kaufmann et al. (2021) demonstrate that collective decision-making processes can be optimized by modeling the interplay between individual cognition and group dynamics. By leveraging active inference, organizations and teams can enhance cooperation, improve problem-solving capabilities, and foster adaptive leadership structures. The implications extend to fields such as organizational psychology, artificial intelligence, and governance, where collective intelligence plays a crucial role in decision-making and strategic planning.

Collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization provide a powerful framework for understanding social behavior, cooperation, and cultural evolution. By extending active inference beyond individual agents to encompass distributed cognition, federated belief updating, and multi-agent coordination, researchers can uncover the principles governing complex adaptive systems. This theoretical approach not only enhances our understanding of human societies but also has practical applications in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to organizational management. As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the principles of collective active inference will play a vital role in shaping the future of collaborative intelligence and social adaptation. Moreover, group-level free energy minimization has profound implications for artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. By implementing active inference in AI systems, researchers aim to develop more adaptive, context-aware, and socially intelligent agents. Parr et al. (2022) highlight how active inference provides a framework for modeling human-like decision-making in autonomous systems, enabling machines to interact with humans in a more intuitive and cooperative manner.

### Federated inference and learning

**Federated inference and learning** represent an approach to distributed cognition, enabling agents to collaboratively enhance their understanding of a shared world. Within the frameworks of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, federated inference and learning emerge as natural consequences of agents striving to minimize surprise and maximize model evidence. This essay explores the principles and mechanisms underlying federated inference and learning, emphasizing the roles of shared generative models, belief sharing, active learning, and the emergence of complexity in multi-agent systems.

At its core, federated inference and learning relies on the concept that multiple agents, each with their own perspective and sensory experiences, can collectively infer the hidden states of a shared environment more effectively than any single agent acting alone. This is achieved through the **sharing of posterior beliefs**, which allows agents to integrate information from diverse sources and refine their internal models of the world. In a federated setting, agents not only minimize their individual free energy but also contribute to the minimization of a **joint free energy** at the group level. This requires agents to share their beliefs and coordinate their actions in a way that maximizes the overall coherence and predictability of the system. The sharing of beliefs can be understood as a form of communication, where agents broadcast their internal states to other members of the group.

**A shared generative model** is crucial for enabling effective communication and belief sharing among agents. The generative model encodes an agent's beliefs about the causal structure of the world, including the relationships between hidden states, observations, and actions. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation.m**Belief sharing** is fundamental to realizing joint free energy minimization, distributed over ensembles of free energy minimizing processes and over the timescales at which these processes unfold. Belief sharing is most effective when agents communicate full belief distributions rather than limiting belief-sharing to a noisy gradient estimate.

As agents engage in federated inference and learning, they not only improve their individual performance but also contribute to the emergence of **collective intelligence** at the group level. Collective intelligence refers to the ability of a group to solve complex problems and make decisions that exceed the capabilities of any single member. Within the active inference framework, collective intelligence emerges from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. As free energy is minimized, **complexity** emerges within the collective. Increased accuracy in understanding the environment leads to increased complexity, reflecting the collective's ability to represent and process information about its surroundings. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment. Active learning and selection complement each other. In active learning, posterior parameters change to minimize variational free energy if, and only if, expected free energy is reduced. Conversely, in active selection, prior parameters change to minimize expected free energy if, and only if, variational free energy is reduced as scored with Bayesian model reduction. The implicit bootstrapping underwrites self-evidencing towards precise and predictable exchanges.

Federated inference and belief sharing represent a critical advancement in our understanding of collective intelligence, distributed cognition, and the mechanisms underlying cooperative behavior. At its core, federated inference is a decentralized approach to information processing, where multiple agents—whether biological, artificial, or hybrid—engage in active inference to minimize free energy and generate a shared, cohesive understanding of their environment. This paradigm is particularly relevant to multi-agent systems, collective behavior, and the emergence of cumulative culture, offering a theoretical foundation for explaining complex social and cognitive phenomena.

One of the essential aspects of federated inference is its role in collective behavior. Heins et al. (2023) explore how surprise minimization governs interactions within social systems, demonstrating that agents engaged in active inference adjust their expectations and responses to align with a broader collective. This process is crucial for large-scale coordination, from ant colonies to human societies, where individuals must reconcile their local predictions with the global network’s evolving structure. The interplay between cognition and collective intelligence has been extensively studied in the context of federated inference. Kaufmann et al. (2021) use active inference to model how cognitive processes interact with distributed intelligence networks, demonstrating that federated belief updating enhances the efficiency and adaptability of multi-agent systems. Their findings suggest that decentralized networks—whether composed of human participants, artificial agents, or hybrid collectives—exhibit superior problem-solving capabilities when they can share and integrate beliefs effectively.

Friston et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive account of federated inference and belief sharing, outlining the computational principles that govern distributed cognition. Their work integrates insights from Bayesian statistics, information theory, and neuroscience to offer a unified framework for understanding how agents synchronize their internal models with external realities. This theoretical foundation has implications for artificial intelligence, robotics, and human-computer interaction, where collaborative intelligence plays a crucial role in system efficiency and adaptability.

Active inference formalizes mental functioning through the imperative to minimize free energy—a measure of surprise or prediction error relative to an agent’s generative model of the world. At the individual level, this manifests as perception updating beliefs to align sensory data with expectations (perceptual inference) and action altering sensory inputs to fulfill predictions (active inference). Crucially, free energy minimization extends beyond isolated agents. In federated systems, groups collectively reduce free energy through belief-sharing protocols that harmonize local inferences into global consensus. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a unifying account of self-organization across scales. Biological systems like fish schools exemplify this: individuals minimize surprise about their neighbors’ movements while collectively exhibiting complex patterns like milling or directed migration. These behaviors emerge not from explicit coordination rules but from each agent’s Bayesian belief updating under a shared generative model. Similarly, federated machine learning frameworks enable devices to collaboratively train models by exchanging parameter updates—a process mathematically analogous to belief propagation in hierarchical active inference systems.  Group-level free energy minimization occurs when agents operate within overlapping "econiches," sharing likelihood mappings between internal beliefs and observable signals. This creates distributed generative models where local inferences contribute to global knowledge integration. For instance, synthetic agents in federated simulations develop emergent communication protocols by minimizing the expected free energy of misunderstood messages. 

Federated architectures implement collective active inference through three core mechanisms: belief-sharing protocols, adaptive learning dynamics, and hierarchical prediction-error minimization. Belief-sharing requires agents to encode posterior beliefs into transmissible signals—a process formalized as likelihood mappings from internal states to observable messages. In federated learning, this corresponds to clients transmitting model updates to a server, which aggregates them into a global belief state. Crucially, message precision (inverse variance) determines their influence during aggregation, mirroring neurobiological mechanisms where prediction errors are weighted by their reliability.  

Learning dynamics in these systems exhibit meta-adaptive properties. Agents not only update beliefs about world states but also optimize the parameters and structure of their generative models. For example, federated learning clients can dynamically adjust batch sizes and learning rates to minimize expected free energy under resource constraints—a process demonstrated in IoT networks where devices balance energy consumption with model accuracy. These adaptations create positive feedback: as agents refine their generative models, their belief-sharing becomes more efficient, accelerating collective inference.  

Hierarchical prediction-error minimization enables federated systems to operate across temporal and spatial scales. At the micro scale, individual agents resolve sensory prediction errors through local belief updates. At the macro scale, the collective minimizes global free energy by redistributing computational loads—as seen in federated networks that shift training tasks from energy-constrained devices to more capable neighbors. This multi-scale optimization emerges naturally from active inference principles, where agents prioritize policies (action sequences) that minimize expected free energy over both immediate and long-term horizons.

Biological collectives provide examples of federated active inference. Fish schools achieve predator detection through distributed belief-sharing: each individual’s visual inferences about potential threats are integrated into a global vigilance state without centralized processing. Simulation studies demonstrate that these systems spontaneously develop hierarchical communication protocols—analogous to federated averaging in machine learning where localized motion cues aggregate into group-level directional consensus. In technological domains, federated active inference enables energy-efficient IoT networks. A 2022 study optimized smartphone-based federated learning by co-running training processes with foreground applications, exploiting underutilized computational cycles to reduce energy consumption by 63%. This approach treats energy expenditure as a form of thermodynamic free energy, applying the FEP to balance model accuracy against battery constraints. Adaptive agents dynamically adjusted batch sizes from 256 to 512 samples based on power availability, demonstrating how free energy minimization generalizes beyond cognitive tasks to resource management.  Scientific communities themselves operate as federated inference systems. Researchers act as Bayesian agents updating hypotheses (beliefs) through peer-reviewed publications (belief-sharing), with the collective goal of minimizing disciplinary prediction error. The replication crisis exemplifies a breakdown in this process, where insufficient error correction allowed high-free-energy models to persist—a scenario analogous to federated systems failing to detect Byzantine clients. Remedies inspired by active inference include preprint servers that accelerate belief propagation and meta-analytic frameworks that weight studies by their predictive precision.  

##### Challenges and Future Directions  

An interesting frontier to progress involves formalizing the "economics" of belief propagation. Agents in open federated systems may manipulate shared beliefs for self-interest—a phenomenon observed in blockchain networks plagued by dishonest nodes. Integrating game-theoretic concepts with active inference could yield mechanisms for detecting and excluding adversarial agents while preserving decentralization. Preliminary work shows promise: by treating trust as a precision parameter in Bayesian belief updates, systems automatically downweight contributions from unreliable participants. Future research must also bridge the gap between biological and artificial federated systems. While machine learning focuses on parameter transmission, biological collectives like ant colonies exchange chemical signals encoding complex priors about resource locations. Developing bio-inspired federated protocols that transmit compressed generative models—rather than raw parameters—could dramatically improve communication efficiency.

### Language and communication

**Language and communication** are critical components of collective behavior, serving as the bridge that connects individual agents within a group and enables the emergence of coordinated, intelligent action. Within the framework of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, language and communication are not merely tools for exchanging information but are fundamental processes that shape the very fabric of social interaction and cultural evolution. When applied to groups, active inference extends to include distributed cognition, joint belief updating, and coordinated action, all of which hinge critically on communication (Kaufmann et al., 2021). Through structured linguistic exchanges, groups can refine shared generative models, facilitating better coordination and reducing free energy at the collective level (Ramstead et al., 2018). This post explores the intricate relationship between language, communication, and collective intelligence, emphasizing how these phenomena arise from the basic principles of **active inference** and **free energy minimization**.

In a social context, **language and communication** play a crucial role in minimizing free energy by enabling agents to share their internal models and coordinate their actions. When agents can communicate effectively, they can pool their knowledge, correct each other's errors, and make more accurate predictions about the world. This leads to a reduction in overall uncertainty and a more robust, adaptive collective. Language serves as a medium for synchronizing internal models among individuals within a group. From an active inference perspective, language can be viewed as an externalized generative model that enables predictive processing across multiple agents (Heyes, 2018). This allows individuals to share expectations, negotiate meaning, and establish conventions that reduce epistemic uncertainty. Through these exchanges, collective entities maintain coherence in their interactions with the environment, enabling large-scale coordination (Friston et al., 2024).

**Communication** is often framed as a process of reducing uncertainty about the world, drawing conversation partners closer through intersubjective reference frames. This perspective casts communication as a means of **mutual attunement**, wherein agents actively infer each other's internal belief states and update their own representations accordingly. The natural result of this bidirectional inference is the synchronization of belief states within the cultural ensemble.  The emergence of cumulative culture is one of the most compelling examples of how communication facilitates collective active inference. According to Kastel et al. (2022), communication enables the transmission of learned priors across generations, contributing to cultural evolution and the refinement of adaptive behaviors. When individuals communicate, they are not just exchanging information but actively co-constructing shared probabilistic models of the world. This process enables the progressive accumulation of knowledge and the optimization of collective behavior, ensuring that groups remain adaptive to their environment (Levchuk et al., 2018).

One key element in this framework is the concept of a **shared generative model**. A generative model is an internal representation of the world that allows agents to make predictions about their sensory experiences. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation. **Belief-sharing plays a crucial role in resolving uncertainty about hidden states**, particularly when observable consequences are only visible to one agent at a time. By communicating their beliefs, agents can collectively build a more complete and accurate representation of their environment, reducing uncertainty and improving decision-making. Communication, in this context, involves not only the content of beliefs but also the confidence with which they are held. **Linguistic communication emerges as agents broadcast their beliefs, increasing the accuracy of their world models and enhancing communication efficiency**. As agents interact and exchange information, they collectively refine their understanding of the world, leading to the emergence of shared meanings and conventions. The structure of language reflects the structure of the underlying generative model and is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world.


Communication also plays a key role in the regulation of group-level free energy minimization by establishing epistemic boundaries—demarcations that define what is relevant within a given social context (Constant et al., 2019). These boundaries, operationalized through linguistic categories and narratives, shape perception and action by constraining the space of possible interpretations. In this way, language functions as a scaffold that both simplifies and enriches the collective generative model, ensuring that social agents remain synchronized in their expectations and responses to the world (Bruineberg et al., 2018). A particularly interesting dimension of language in active inference is its role in normativity and social change. Buskell (2020) argues that linguistic communication is essential for negotiating social norms and modifying collective priors. Through discourse, groups can challenge existing generative models and introduce new inferential structures that alter patterns of belief and behavior. This capacity for reflective self-modification underscores the flexibility of collective active inference and highlights how language is not just a medium for transmitting knowledge but a mechanism for reshaping the cognitive landscape of groups (Veissière et al., 2019).

The complexity of language allows humans to convey not only the content of beliefs but also the **confidence** in those beliefs. Communication in this sense is more than just the transmission of information; it includes the nuances and subtleties that allow for a deeper understanding between individuals. This deeper exchange can lead to the emergence of shared expectations and narratives that reduce free energy. However, **efficient communication** is not without its challenges. The environment itself does not impose the practical constraints that drive real-life human behaviors. The model can be expanded to include practical constraints and real-world dynamics to address these issues. Furthermore, indirect information sharing can introduce the risk of amplifying noisy or irrelevant information, leading to maladaptive group outcomes.
 Communication relies on agents having precise **likelihood mappings**, and agents acquire these mappings because they expect to acquire them. When agents are devoid of language capabilities, they can still develop language mappings through interaction and exposure. The convergence to a common ground or frame of reference is mediated by free energy selection processes at the level of the model structure, using Bayesian model reduction.

The creation and use of language can be seen as a process of **scientific niche construction (SNC)**, wherein the environment is modified to influence expectations and drive actions aimed at confirming hypotheses. In this view, models guide the collection of new evidence, and new evidence refines the models, creating an ongoing cycle of hypothesis generation, evidence collection, and hypothesis revision that drives scientific progress. In the context of niche construction, language serves as a cultural artifact that shapes the environment in which inference takes place (Hesp et al., 2019). Through repeated use, linguistic structures become embedded in social practices, externalizing aspects of cognition and enabling more efficient coordination. As Friston et al. (2019) suggest, language can be considered a form of epistemic engineering—an adaptive mechanism that structures inference at both individual and collective levels. This perspective aligns with Kirchhoff et al. (2018), who propose that the Markov blankets defining social systems are partially constituted by linguistic constructs that delineate informational boundaries within groups.

By enabling agents to share their internal models, coordinate their actions, and learn from each other's experiences, language and communication facilitate the minimization of free energy at both the individual and collective levels. As agents engage in these processes, they contribute to the creation of shared knowledge, the evolution of cultural norms, and the ability of collectives to solve complex problems and adapt to changing environments. Further research into the dynamics of language and communication within active inference promises to yield valuable insights into the nature of social behavior and the potential for creating more intelligent, cooperative, and resilient societies.

### Shared generative model

In collective behavior, **macroscopic patterns emerge from decentralized, local interactions**, showcasing a range of behaviors from directed movement to disordered swarming. Modeling these phenomena through active inference offers a unique perspective, casting behavior as a consequence of individual agents minimizing surprise. This approach contrasts with traditional models that depict individuals as self-propelled particles subject to social forces. Instead, active inference treats organisms as probabilistic decision-makers, suggesting that collective behaviors arise naturally from active Bayesian inference, **without explicitly programming behavioral rules or goals into individual agents**.


**Collective intelligence**, viewed through the lens of active inference, is understood as a system's capacity to minimize free energy or perform approximate Bayesian inference at a collective level. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual interactions in producing intelligent collective behavior that transcends individual capabilities. A centeral concept of collective active inference is the **shared generative model**, wherein agents possess a common understanding of their shared world, enabling distributed Bayesian belief updating. This necessitates a common frame of reference, with belief structures and representations conserved across agents. The shared generative model allows agents to inherit and assimilate each other's perspectives, enhancing their ability to navigate and make sense of their environment.



Active inference can be applied across multiple scales, with collectives of active inference agents maintaining a group-level Markov blanket and acting as a larger group-level active inference agent with its own generative model. This multi-scale application highlights the potential for nested hierarchies of active inference processes, where individual agents contribute to the behavior of larger collectives, which in turn influence the behavior of even larger systems.


**System-level free energy measures collective performance**, with lower free energy indicating higher system performance. Cognitive sophistication at the individual level is associated with reductions in free energy at the system level. This suggests that enhancing the cognitive abilities of individual agents can lead to improvements in the overall performance of the collective.

Constraints naturally arise from free energy minimization, influencing language and communication. These constraints, derived from the generative model, shape the structure of language and the ways in which agents interact and exchange information. The free energy principle is dual to the constrained maximum entropy principle, where the constraints inherit from the generative model.

As free energy is minimized, complexity emerges, with increased accuracy in understanding the environment leading to increased complexity. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment.

Active inference offers explanations of how an agent resists a natural tendency to entropy. By minimizing free energy, agents maintain their integrity and stability in the face of environmental fluctuations and challenges. Through prediction error minimization and temporally extended planning, agents proactively shape their environment to align with their expectations and goals.

Within the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization, **the concept of a shared generative model is essential for understanding how individual agents coordinate and interact to produce coherent collective behavior.** This shared model serves as a common ground, enabling agents to interpret each other's actions, anticipate future events, and make decisions that align with the goals of the group.

The shared generative model encompasses not only beliefs about the environment but also expectations about the behavior of other agents. This allows agents to engage in social interactions, cooperate towards common objectives, and adapt to changing social dynamics. The shared model also facilitates the transmission of knowledge and skills across generations, contributing to the accumulation of culture and the evolution of social norms.

However, challenges remain in fully understanding the emergence and dynamics of shared generative models. One key question is how agents initially develop these shared models and how they are updated and refined over time through interaction and learning. Another challenge is to elucidate the relationship between individual and collective goals and how agents balance their own interests with the needs of the group.

Despite these challenges, the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization offers a promising approach to understanding the complexities of collective behavior. By combining insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and information theory, this framework provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing a wide range of phenomena, from animal social behavior to human cultural dynamics.

The implications of this framework extend beyond theoretical understanding. By providing a formal and quantitative account of collective intelligence, active inference can inform the design of artificial intelligence systems that are capable of collaborating and coordinating effectively in complex environments. Moreover, insights from active inference can be applied to improve organizational decision-making, enhance team performance, and foster more resilient and adaptive social systems.

In conclusion, the shared generative model is a central concept in the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization. It provides a foundation for understanding how individual agents coordinate and interact to produce coherent collective behavior, learn from their environment, and adapt to changing circumstances. By continuing to explore the emergence and dynamics of shared generative models, researchers can gain valuable insights into the nature of collective intelligence and its potential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.

### Collective intelligence


Collective intelligence, as an emergent phenomenon, describes a system where interacting agents achieve performance levels exceeding the sum of their individual capabilities. Within the framework of collective active inference and group-level free energy minimization, this intelligence arises from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. This essay explores how collective intelligence emerges within this framework, emphasizing the importance of shared generative models, belief sharing, and the multi-scale nature of active inference.

At the heart of collective active inference lies the principle that **agents, whether individuals or collectives, are fundamentally driven to minimize their variational free energy**. Variational free energy can be understood as the difference between the sensory data registered by the system and the data expected under some model of how the data were generated. This minimization imperative leads agents to actively engage with their environment, make predictions, and update their internal models based on incoming sensory information. In a collective setting, this process is not confined to individual agents but extends to the group level, where the collective itself acts as a higher-order agent striving to minimize its overall free energy.

A cornerstone of collective intelligence within this framework is the **shared generative model**. The shared generative model encompasses not only beliefs about the environment but also expectations about the behavior of other agents. This allows agents to engage in social interactions, cooperate towards common objectives, and adapt to changing social dynamics. **This shared model serves as a common ground, enabling agents to interpret each other's actions, anticipate future events, and make decisions that align with the goals of the group**. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation. The shared model also facilitates the transmission of knowledge and skills across generations, contributing to the accumulation of culture and the evolution of social norms. It's through communication via broadcasting beliefs that agents can increase the accuracy of their world models and enhance communication efficiency.

**Belief sharing** is another critical component of collective intelligence. Agents communicate their beliefs about the environment and the actions of other agents. By sharing beliefs, agents can collectively reduce uncertainty and improve their understanding of the world. This is particularly important when individual agents have limited or incomplete information. Belief-sharing appears to be a fundamental aspect of realizing joint free energy minimization, distributed over ensembles of free energy minimizing processes and over the timescales at which these processes unfold. Belief sharing is most effective when agents communicate full belief distributions rather than limiting belief-sharing to a noisy gradient estimate.

Active inference operates across multiple scales. Individual agents form collectives, which in turn can form larger-scale systems. **Collectives of active inference agents can maintain a group-level Markov blanket**, effectively acting as a larger group-level agent with its own generative model. This multi-scale perspective allows us to understand how individual actions contribute to collective behavior and how collective-level dynamics influence individual agents.

Within the collective active inference framework, several cognitive mechanisms facilitate the emergence of collective intelligence. **Theory of Mind**, the ability to understand that other agents have their own beliefs and intentions, allows agents to better predict the behavior of others and coordinate their actions. **Goal alignment**, the degree to which agents share common objectives, promotes cooperation and reduces conflict within the collective. **Communication**, the exchange of information between agents, enables the sharing of beliefs and the coordination of actions. It has been found that shared goals have a natural connection with the global optimum states, meaning that shared goals emerge endogenously from the agents’ interaction with their social environment.

System-level free energy serves as a measure of collective performance. Lower free energy indicates higher system performance, reflecting the collective's ability to accurately predict and control its environment. Cognitive sophistication at the individual level is associated with reductions in free energy at the system level, suggesting that enhancing the cognitive abilities of individual agents can lead to improvements in the overall performance of the collective.

Constraints play a crucial role in shaping collective behavior within the active inference framework. These constraints, derived from the generative model, influence language, communication, and the ways in which agents interact and exchange information. As agents minimize free energy, they adapt to these constraints, leading to the emergence of stable patterns of behavior and communication.

As free energy is minimized, complexity emerges within the collective. Increased accuracy in understanding the environment leads to increased complexity, reflecting the collective's ability to represent and process information about its surroundings. This emergence of complexity underscores the adaptive nature of active inference, where systems become more sophisticated and capable as they interact with and learn from their environment.

Active inference provides explanations of how agents resist a natural tendency to entropy. By minimizing free energy, agents maintain their integrity and stability in the face of environmental fluctuations and challenges. Through prediction error minimization and temporally extended planning, agents proactively shape their environment to align with their expectations and goals.

Active inference can inform the design of artificial intelligence systems capable of collaborating and coordinating effectively in complex environments. Moreover, insights from active inference can be applied to improve organizational decision-making, enhance team performance, and foster more resilient and adaptive social systems.

Collective intelligence within the collective active inference framework emerges from the dynamic interplay of individual agents striving to minimize their surprise and uncertainty about the world. The shared generative model, belief sharing, multi-scale organization, and cognitive mechanisms such as Theory of Mind and goal alignment all contribute to this emergent intelligence. By continuing to explore these concepts, we can gain valuable insights into the nature of collective behavior and its potential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.

**System-level free energy** is a critical concept within the frameworks of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, offering a way to understand how individual interactions and behaviors aggregate to produce coherent, adaptive dynamics at the scale of the entire system. This essay will explore the meaning of system-level free energy, how it relates to individual agent behavior, and how it facilitates understanding collective intelligence and coordinated action.

To fully appreciate **system-level free energy**, one must first understand the basic principles of the **free energy principle (FEP)** and **active inference**. The FEP suggests that any self-organizing system that maintains itself in a non-equilibrium steady-state does so by minimizing its **variational free energy**. **Variational free energy** is an information-theoretic measure that bounds the surprise or unexpectedness of sensory inputs, given the system's internal model of the world.

**Active inference** extends the FEP by proposing that organisms actively seek to minimize free energy through perception and action. Perception involves updating internal models to better predict sensory inputs, while action involves changing the environment to match the predictions of the internal model. In other words, agents act to create the world they expect to experience, thereby minimizing surprise and maintaining their integrity.

In a collective setting, these principles extend to multiple interacting agents. **Collective active inference** suggests that groups of agents can also be understood as self-organizing systems that minimize free energy at a collective level. This means that the interactions and behaviors of individual agents contribute to an overall system-level drive to reduce surprise and maintain stability.

**System-level free energy** is not simply the sum of the individual free energies of the agents within the system. Instead, it reflects the overall coherence and predictability of the system's behavior as a whole. It captures the extent to which the system's dynamics align with a generative model that represents the expected behavior of the collective.

One way to conceptualize **system-level free energy** is through the lens of **hierarchical systems**. Multi-scale formulations of the FEP rest upon the formal tools that underwrite the study of adiabatic processes and the renormalisation group. Nature manifests a nested, multiscale organization: with small, fast things coalescing into progressively larger, and slower things. Stable dynamics at one scale can be treated as random fluctuations at the next, superordinate scale.

In such systems, individual agents can be seen as nested within a larger collective, with each level operating to minimize its free energy. The actions of individual agents influence the state of the collective, and the state of the collective, in turn, influences the behavior of individual agents. This creates a feedback loop where individual and collective dynamics are deeply intertwined.

**Communication** plays a critical role in shaping **system-level free energy**. By exchanging information, agents can coordinate their actions and align their internal models, leading to more coherent and predictable collective behavior. When agents share a common understanding of the environment and each other's intentions, they can act more effectively as a unit, reducing overall surprise and minimizing system-level free energy.

However, achieving **efficient communication** and coordination is not always straightforward. Agents may have incomplete or inaccurate information, conflicting goals, or limited cognitive resources. These factors can lead to misunderstandings, errors, and suboptimal collective outcomes.

One approach to modeling **system-level free energy** involves creating computational models with multiple interacting agents. In these models, each agent is endowed with a generative model and acts to minimize its free energy through perception and action. The interactions between agents are then simulated, and the resulting system-level dynamics are analyzed to assess the overall free energy of the collective.

For example, one can construct a simple 1D search task in which two **active inference** agents interact as they pursue individual and shared goals. By endowing agents with cognitive abilities such as Theory of Mind and Goal Alignment and varying these abilities systematically, the effects on individual and **system-level free energy** can be measured.

One such simulation involves an ensemble of M identical copies of a two-agent subsystem, each in its own independent environment. From this vantage point, each of the 2M agents is now a “point particle” described only by its position. The tuple is then the set of internal states of the system as a whole. The model allows analysis of both agent level and system level performance.

The behavior of such systems can then be analyzed at multiple levels, such as:
*   The agent level, examining individual strategies and adaptation
*   The subsystem level, describing local interaction and coordination
*   The system level, measuring the aggregate behavior of all agents

Simulations show that improvements in global-scale inference are greatest when local-scale performance optima of individuals align with the system’s global expected state. Crucially, the system-level inference emerges as a product of self-organizing **active inference** agents endowed with simple social cognitive mechanisms.

Another way to analyze **system-level free energy** is by drawing on the concept of a **Markov blanket**. A Markov blanket is a statistical boundary that separates a system from its environment. It consists of a set of states that render the internal states of the system conditionally independent of the external states. In other words, the Markov blanket shields the system from direct influence from the environment, allowing it to maintain its integrity and autonomy.

In a collective of **active inference** agents, the group itself can be seen as having a **Markov blanket**, with the individual agents forming the internal states of the system and the environment surrounding the group forming the external states. The interactions and communication between agents serve as the blanket states, mediating the flow of information between the group and its environment.

By minimizing **system-level free energy**, the collective can maintain its **Markov blanket** and ensure its continued survival and adaptation. This perspective highlights the importance of social interaction and communication in creating a robust and resilient collective.

Moreover, **cultural evolution** is closely tied to communication. Through dialogue, individual mental models are modified, and distinct representations converge to a shared narrative. This attunement of interlocutors translates over time into collective free energy minimization. In cases where divergent beliefs exist, communication can become intractable, and communicative isolation between incongruent groups may emerge as a strategy to minimize expected free energy.

The proper selection of actions and policies is a critical component of free energy minimization. Action selection and planning then consists of choosing the action policy associated with the lowest expected free energy, given the expected trajectory of states and observations. Actions are chosen that are expected to lead to observations which are informative about the environment but also similar to prior preferences, with the balance between the two being controlled by the precision of prior preferences.

The approach of minimizing free energy can be used to model distributed scientific cognition at multiple scales, where active inference enables significant progress in finding the artificial neural correlates of scientific cognition. This can enhance our understanding of both human scientific cognition and the capabilities of artificial intelligence systems.

Importantly, the **FEP naturally offers scale-free heuristics to make sense of complex, self-organising dynamics at different scales**. The areas of concern of agents can grow via higher-order pattern formation, with community formation enabling the extension of an area of concern. The process of scientific investigation can be seen as a process of cumulative knowledge and technology construction, which can be seen as extending the area of concern of human agents to a nearly unlimited scope.

In summary, **system-level free energy** is a powerful concept for understanding how individual interactions and behaviors give rise to coherent, adaptive dynamics at the collective level. By minimizing **system-level free energy**, collectives can maintain their integrity, coordinate their actions, and adapt to changing environments. Further research into the dynamics of **system-level free energy** promises to yield valuable insights into the nature of collective intelligence and the potential for creating more cooperative and resilient societies.

### Active Inference and Collective Behavior

Active inference frames behavior as a consequence of minimizing surprise or prediction error, thereby blending cognitive and physics-based approaches. This perspective is particularly salient when seeking to understand collective behaviors exhibited by animal groups. The framework offers a testable model for studies of biological collective motion, facilitating empirical investigation and validation.

**Collective intelligence**, which can be defined as the capacity of a group to act in ways that appear intelligent and which cannot be explained by individual intelligence, can be effectively operationalized using active inference. Within this framework, collective intelligence is understood as a composite system's ability to minimize free energy or perform approximate Bayesian inference at the collective level. This approach is broadly applicable to any composite system, extending beyond just human collectives.

At the heart of this perspective is **the free energy principle (FEP)**, a mathematical formulation describing how adaptive systems resist a natural tendency toward disorder. The FEP posits that any non-equilibrium steady-state system self-organizes by minimizing variational free energy in its interactions with the environment. This principle can be translated into active inference, providing a basis for modeling self-organizing biological systems across various scales.

**Active inference allows for multiscale modeling of collective intelligence**, where individual agents interact to produce a superordinate agent at the collective level. This approach necessitates an examination of the minimal features required for autonomous individual active inference agents to achieve collective intelligence, operationalized as active inference at the global-scale system.

### Key Cognitive Abilities

Several key cognitive abilities facilitate collective intelligence within the active inference framework:

*   **Baseline Active Inference (AIF)**: Agents minimize immediate free energy by accurately sensing and acting on salient affordances in the environment. This foundational ability ensures that agents respond effectively to immediate environmental demands.
*   **Folk Psychology**: Agents minimize free energy relative to both their physical and social environments, assuming other agents are self-similar and differentiating other-generated information by calculating how it diverges from self-generated information. This enables agents to predict and respond to the behavior of others within the group.
*   **Shared Norms**: Agents engage with shared norms as a proxy for discovering mutually viable shared goals, leveraging socio-cultural affordances to cue adaptive collective behavior. This promotes cohesion and coordinated action within the group.

Computational models that incorporate these abilities demonstrate that individual-level capabilities are associated with improvements in the system's ability to perform approximate Bayesian inference and minimize variational free energy. Improvements in global-scale inference are greatest when local-scale performance optima of individuals align with the system’s global expected state.

### Belief Sharing and Federated Inference

**Belief sharing** is a critical component of collective active inference, referring to the process by which agents communicate their beliefs about a shared world. This federated inference allows agents to resolve uncertainty about hidden states, especially when observable consequences can only be perceived by one agent at a time. Through a shared generative model, agents can distribute Bayesian belief updating, with each agent assimilating the perspectives of others.

**Federated learning** enhances communication effectiveness by enabling agents to communicate full belief distributions rather than being limited to sharing noisy gradient estimates. This approach allows agents to jointly learn the likelihood parameters of the communication modality, effectively developing a private code decipherable only with access to the same shared belief space.

In this context, **belief updating** differs significantly from traditional Bayesian belief updating, where agents would have varying posterior beliefs based on their individual priors. Conversely, belief sharing assimilates posteriors to evince a consensus, often likened to a "hive mind," wherein agents inherit both the likelihood and priors from one another. Crucially, beliefs are shared only when they pertain to the same states of the world and are understood within a shared frame of reference.

### The Role of Communication and Language

Facilitated by belief sharing, **communication** enables agents to benefit from complementary perspectives and observations. The acquisition of language, or likelihood mappings, can be achieved through active learning, wherein individuals learn from others within their environment. Moreover, language can emerge de novo in an ensemble of agents exposed to shared visual scenes, with precise likelihood mappings that are conserved across agents.

**Active learning and selection** are complementary processes; posterior parameters change to minimize variational free energy if and only if expected free energy is reduced, while prior parameters change to minimize expected free energy if and only if variational free energy is reduced. This iterative process promotes self-evidencing toward precise and predictable exchanges.

### Cultural Niche Construction

Within the framework of collective active inference, **cultural niche construction** refers to the phenomenon whereby agents actively structure their external environment to render it more measurable and knowable. Scientists, for instance, aim to elicit observations that align with their expectations, which are, in turn, shaped by the external cultural niche. This process is inextricably linked to model refinement, where models guide the collection of new evidence, and that new evidence subsequently refines the models.

**Scientific Niche Construction (SNC)** profoundly shapes how scientists perceive the world and drives their actions to generate evidence that confirms their hypotheses. This iterative cycle of hypothesis generation, evidence collection, and hypothesis revision underpins scientific progress.

### Challenges and Future Directions

Despite significant advances in understanding collective behavior through the lens of active inference, several challenges and open questions remain:

*   **Indirect Information Sharing**: In many natural collective scenarios, common signals may only indirectly relate to shared contextual variables, leading to noisy, ambiguous sensory inputs and increasing the risk of amplifying irrelevant information. Further research is needed to understand how agents can effectively filter and integrate such indirect signals.
*   **Optimal Sensory Information Channels**: Identifying the specific sensory information channels and corresponding likelihood models that enable a group to perform optimally in tasks such as consensus decision-making remains an area for further exploration. Understanding the conditions under which certain channels are more effective than others is crucial.
*   **Generative Model Updates**: It remains an open question how conspecifics should update their generative models to minimize collective free energy rather than individual-level free energy. Developing a more nuanced understanding of this process is essential for understanding how groups can achieve optimal performance.
*   **Integration of Individual and Collective Cognition:** Computational models of scientific cognition must account for the dual interaction between individual and collective levels to fully grasp the functioning of science and the dynamics of scientific cognition. Further work is required to integrate these perspectives into cohesive models.

### Conclusion

**Belief sharing** serves as a cornerstone of collective active inference, enabling groups to minimize free energy and maximize their understanding of a shared world. The active inference framework, with its emphasis on minimizing surprise and prediction error, provides a potent lens through which to examine the emergence of collective intelligence and the dynamics of social interaction. By integrating individual and collective cognition, this framework offers a multiscale approach to understanding cultural evolution processes and the complex interplay between agents and their environments. As research in this area continues to evolve, a deeper understanding of belief sharing and its implications for collective behavior will likely lead to new insights into both natural and artificial systems.
