The free energy principle and active inference framework offer a novel computational perspective for understanding psychiatric disorders, framing them as disorders of inference. This framework provides a unified explanation of how maladaptive beliefs and perceptions can lead to conditions like anxiety and depression by disrupting the brain's ability to minimize uncertainty. In this context here we outline FEP accounts of anxiety and depression. For anxiety, traditional models have emphasized cognitive biases and learned responses, but the free energy principle suggests that anxiety stems from a persistent mismatch between expected and actual outcomes, leading to irreducible uncertainty. Similarly, in depression, the framework explains rumination as a failure in the brain's generative models to effectively reduce uncertainty, leading to persistent negative thought patterns and maladaptive problem-solving strategies. By integrating insights from biological, behavioral, and cognitive theories, the free energy principle and active inference framework provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and treating these mental health conditions, highlighting the importance of addressing learned uncertainty and maladaptive cognitive processes in therapeutic interventions.


#### Anxiety

Traditional models of generalized anxiety suggest that false beliefs and biases lead to heightened and sustained anxiety responses. Early behavioral models focused on conditioning, where anxiety is learned in specific situations, causing anticipatory anxiety upon re-entering similar contexts. Pioneers like Beck and Ellis identified cognitive biases, such as catastrophizing and dualistic thinking, that distort perceptions and exacerbate anxiety. These biases result in a feedback loop where anxiety reinforces itself through misinterpretation of bodily sensations, as seen in Clark's model of panic attacks. While cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been effective in clinical practice, it faces criticism because anxiety symptoms often persist even after erroneous beliefs are addressed.

Several theorists have proposed alternative ways to understand anxiety-related beliefs, challenging traditional models like CBT. Kelly suggested that beliefs are not static but have qualities such as being tight or loose, affecting how they influence perception. Emotion-focused therapies, on the other hand, argue that emotions precede belief formation, and thus anxiety should be understood through the factors that determine emotions. Here we present a new perspective grounded in the free energy principle and active inference, suggesting that anxiety can be re-conceptualized within the framework of working generative models. This view diverges from existing models by focusing on how individuals without initial anxiety may develop anxiety through the process of learning and updating beliefs about uncertainty. 

The proposed approach aims to unify biological, behaviorist, and cognitivist theories by explaining anxiety as a result of bottom-up belief propagation within a systemic optimization framework. This means that rather than seeing anxiety as stemming from fixed erroneous beliefs, it is viewed as a dynamic process where beliefs about uncertainty are continuously updated based on experiences. This model offers a comprehensive understanding of anxiety formation, bridging gaps between various theoretical perspectives and providing a holistic approach to addressing anxiety disorders.

The free energy principle offers a comprehensive framework for understanding anxiety by conceptualizing it as lack of certainty about the effectiveness of actions in reducing uncertainty levels. According to this principle, anxiety arises when there is a persistent mismatch between expected outcomes of actions and the actual outcomes encountered, leading to an irreducible uncertainty about action policies. This sustained uncertainty impairs the system’s ability to develop adaptive models for minimizing expected free energy, resulting in a perception-action cycle dominated by unpredictable outcomes. Consequently, the system learns to expect uncertainty, which in turn reinforces the perception of an unpredictable world. This learned uncertainty is particularly detrimental because it prevents the system from developing adaptive responses, similar to the concept of learned helplessness.

 Biological systems strive to return to a limited number of attracting states to ensure their survival. Hence, the system’s goal remains the minimization of free energy to avoid dissolution into non-characteristic states like death or decay. Therefore, anxiety can be seen as learned uncertainty regarding the sufficiency of the system’s world model and action policies in achieving preferred outcomes. This uncertainty is derived from feedback on the efficacy of action policies in reducing uncertainty. Even though the system continues to attempt minimizing uncertainty, it lacks adaptive methods to do so, as it perceives the world as inherently unpredictable. This perception removes the epistemic affordance of novelty, crucial for resolving uncertainty through expected information gain.

Persistent anxious states, characteristic of anxiety disorders, emerge from the system learning irreducible uncertainty through continuous model updating and action policies. This aligns with experiential accounts of anxiety, where individuals with anxiety disorders perceive the world as unsafe and unpredictable, in contrast to those with lower anxiety levels who view the world as safe and trustworthy. A biological system with a history of persistent uncertainty is likely to expect ambiguous feedback about the effectiveness of its world model and action policies in reducing future uncertainty. This expectation persists regardless of whether the actual uncertainty is reducible, leading to a disproportionate perception of uncertainty. Thus, the system learns that its model and action policies are insufficient for minimizing uncertainty, resulting in the psychological experience of generalized anxiety.

From an affective or emotional inference perspective, anxiety can be understood as part of the generative model that best explains the state of affairs. The experience of anxiety reflects the system’s recognition of its state of uncertainty, manifesting as the thought, “I must be anxious because I cannot decide what to do.” Therefore, experienced anxiety indicates that the biological system has sufficiently expressive generative models to acknowledge its uncertainty. This approach unifies the understanding of anxiety by explaining how continuous exposure to uncertain outcomes leads to a persistent state of learned uncertainty, ultimately resulting in anxiety disorders.

Understanding anxiety through the lens of the free energy principle involves examining how the brain forms hierarchical models to predict and interpret sensory data. These hierarchical models, described as deep temporal models, operate on different levels where lower-level models handle immediate sensory inputs and higher-level models integrate these inputs over time to infer broader contexts. Anxiety emerges when there is a persistent mismatch between predicted and actual outcomes, leading to a state of irreducible uncertainty about the effectiveness of one's actions.

In hierarchical modeling, lower-level models process immediate observations while higher-level models integrate these observations to form more stable beliefs over time. For instance, if an agent continuously experiences unpredictable outcomes they receive feedback that their current models are inadequate for reliably predicting outcomes. This leads to a situation where the agent becomes uncertain about the utility of their action policies. This learned uncertainty disrupts the agent's ability to develop adaptive responses, resulting in a cycle where the agent continually perceives the world as unpredictable, which is a foundational aspect of anxiety disorders.

This process can be understood through Bayesian learning, where the brain updates its beliefs based on new information. When an agent's experiences consistently indicate that their actions do not lead to predictable outcomes, the agent's higher-level models adapt to this perceived unpredictability. This creates a belief system where uncertainty becomes a central feature, even if the actual world is not as unpredictable as the agent perceives it to be. Consequently, the agent develops anxious beliefs that persistently expect uncertainty, which interferes with their ability to respond adaptively to new situations.

Persistent uncertainty is a well-documented precursor to anxiety. Research shows that early experiences of unpredictability can lead to more severe anxiety symptoms later in life. This suggests that initial exposure to uncertainty can shape how an individual's brain models the world, leading to a long-term expectation of unpredictability. These early experiences set the stage for the development of generalized anxiety, where the individual continually perceives and reacts to the world as if it were inherently uncertain.

Distinguishing between accurately modeling a truly uncertain world and inaccurately modeling a certain world is crucial. In some cases, the world genuinely is uncertain, and modeling this accurately does not necessarily lead to anxiety. However, anxiety arises when the brain inaccurately models the world as uncertain even when it is not. This misalignment occurs when the brain's models persistently expect uncertainty due to prior experiences, leading to a new state of homeostasis based on learned uncertainty. This pathological state causes the individual to behave as if the world is uncertain, even when it becomes more predictable. Although the model described simplifies the complex processes involved in anxiety formation, it highlights the importance of how the brain differentiates between internal and external states. This differentiation, known as the Markov blanket, is crucial for understanding how the brain's internal models interact with external realities. Future research will need to delve deeper into these interoceptive aspects to fully understand anxiety.

#### Depression
The free energy principle has been proposed as a unifying framework where depression emerges from a collection of depressive beliefs or distorted representations of the world, particularly related to reward representation. Rumination involves repetitive and often unproductive thoughts about one’s mood, problems, and their origins, which typically leads to a depressed mood and hampers problem-solving. This persistent mental state can lead to mental disorders like major depression. Despite extensive research and various models explaining rumination, its exact function remains unclear. 

The active inference framework helps explain how rumination, a key aspect of MDD and a marker for comorbidity between depression and anxiety, can lead to pathologies by disrupting the brain's ability to minimize uncertainty. Rumination's process is explained through the brain's use of hierarchical generative models. These models are structured in layers, where lower layers process immediate sensory input and higher layers integrate this information to form broader predictions. This hierarchical structure allows the brain to make predictions about state transitions over time. Mental simulation, or "running imaginary actions," plays a crucial role in this process, enabling the brain to optimize generative models without overt action. This involves evaluating policies (sequences of actions) based on their expected ability to reduce uncertainty and make accurate predictions.

In the context of rumination, distortions in mental simulation can lead to excessive and maladaptive thinking patterns. The process of mental simulation is divided into three steps: generating candidates for simulation from possible experiences, choosing a candidate to focus on, and utilizing the chosen candidate to reduce prediction errors through mental problem-solving. Distortions in any of these steps can result in depressive rumination. Active inference suggests that the brain constructs internal models to predict vital parameters essential for survival, creating "self-fulfilling prophecies" through its actions. In the case of rumination, the brain fails to update its models adaptively, leading to persistent uncertainty and anxiety. This framework emphasizes the importance of understanding rumination not just as a maladaptive cognitive process but as a disruption in the brain’s ability to optimize its generative models, this perspective provides a comprehensive explanation for how rumination develops and persists, leading to depression and other mental disorders.

Several factors contribute to this unsuccessful mental problem-solving, resulting in stabilized rumination. First, the high computational complexity of real-world problems, especially interpersonal and social situations, makes them difficult to solve. Depressed individuals may struggle to approximate solutions due to the high computational demands required for such complex tasks. Additionally, the complex nature of problems involved in rumination often demands unrealistic precision, making perfect solutions unattainable and prolonging rumination. Traumatic events, sorrow, and anxiety can exacerbate this demand for precision.

Likewise, depressed individuals might overestimate losses and prematurely discard potentially successful paths due to initial minor losses. This results in fewer options being pursued. Furthermore, missing action policies due to limited experiences increase computational efforts and restrict the number of viable solutions. Biases in policy selection further contribute to prolonged rumination. Learned helplessness occurs when repeated failures lead individuals to conclude that uncertainty cannot be resolved, reducing their engagement in problem-solving. This shifts their belief system, making them less likely to pursue deeper mental exploration. The lack of alternative behavioral policies due to the generative model’s poor fit reduces the estimated pragmatic value of actions, making individuals less likely to engage in new behaviors. This imbalance leads to more candidate sampling rather than actual problem-solving. As, the process of sampling policy candidates can also be biased and intercorrelated, yielding limited and repetitive policy options. Depressed individuals often remain in similar physical and emotional states, leading to repetitive sampling of similar policy candidates. This feedback loop reduces the likelihood of finding effective solutions. Additionally, poor model fit and inefficient action policies result in less informative sensory data, exacerbating rumination by relying more on cognitively generated prediction errors.

Long-term rumination has several negative consequences such opportunity costs it brings about, as neither pragmatic nor epistemic value is mined during depressive rumination. This leads to a decline in behavioral output and general model fit, creating a vicious cycle where biases intensify over time. The brain’s continuous optimization of its knowledge structure can make ruminative states a default response, hindering effective problem-solving and reducing intrinsic motivation. Rumination also distorts both experiential and narrative self-perceptions, making it difficult to update with new information and perpetuating negative self-perceptions. This distorted narrative self influences hyperpriors over candidates for thought, further entrenching ruminative patterns.

As a treatment framework along these lines to avoid repetitive sampling, therapists should consider the context, mood, or bodily states during problem-solving. Activities like endurance training can reduce rumination by promoting neurogenesis, integrating the emotional flanker task with CBT helps patients shift attention away from negative thought patterns. Along the same lines, metacognitive and acceptance and commitment therapies have shown promise by guiding cognitive processes and goal setting based on personal values. Explicitly incorporating problem complexity estimations and analyzing the costs and benefits of mental engagement can further refine treatments. Patients should learn to predict the time and benefits of solving problems through mental simulation compared to overt actions. It is also important to highlight the shared etiology between MDD and anxiety disorders, with rumination being a common factor. Thus, the proposed improvements for treating rumination in MDD could be beneficial for other psychiatric conditions, such as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Preventing excessive rumination should be a key therapeutic target across various psychological disorders.

The free energy principle and active inference framework provide a computational account for understanding various psychiatric disorders as disorders of inference. Here are some examples from the scientific literature on how this framework can be applied to psychiatric disorders:


#### Schizophrenia
According to the active inference framework, symptoms like hallucinations or delusions in schizophrenia can be explained as resulting from false inferences about the causes of sensory inputs [1][2]. Specifically, an aberrant regulation of the precision parameter, which weights sensory evidence against prior beliefs, can lead to hallucinations if unreliable sensory data is given too much precision compared to prior beliefs [2].

#### Autism Spectrum Disorder  


The free energy principle (FEP) and active inference framework provide a comprehensive computational model to understand autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These frameworks conceptualize ASD as a disorder of inference, where the brain's ability to predict and respond to sensorial and social stimuli is altered due to atypical precision weighting and predictive coding mechanisms. Orthodox autism research often suggests that autistic individuals have an impaired theory of mind, which refers to the ability to infer others' mental states. This theory of mind is divided into Theory Theory and Simulation Theory. However, phenomenological perspectives, such as enactivism, critique these views as overly cognitive and not accounting for the embodied and ecological nature of cognition. Enactivism posits that social understanding arises from direct sensorimotor interactions rather than abstract cognitive processes. It views the brain, body, and environment as a unified system in which the brain acts as a mediating organ. Predictive Processing framework is based on Bayesian probability, puts that the brain continuously generates predictions that are compared with actual sensory data, with discrepancies termed prediction errors. In autistic individuals, the integration of these predictions and sensory signals is atypical, leading to experiences of sensory overload in environments like supermarkets. In other words, in autistic experiences, such as meltdowns or shutdowns, the autopoietic system is overwhelmed by prediction errors. 


**Aberrant Precision Weighting**

The concept of precision weighting refers to the reliability or confidence assigned to different sources of information, whether sensory inputs or prior beliefs. From a Bayesian perspective, the brain constantly generates hypotheses about the causes of sensory evidence, which can be seen as prior expectations formed over various timescales and hierarchical levels, from basic visual patterns to complex facial expressions. Predictive coding theories suggest that higher brain areas generate top-down predictions that meet bottom-up signals in lower sensory areas. The mismatch between sensory input and predictions, called prediction error, informs higher-level expectations to generate better predictions and reduce future errors. The influence of prior beliefs versus sensory evidence is modulated by precision, or the confidence in prediction errors at each hierarchical level. High sensory precision amplifies the influence of ascending prediction errors, while low sensory precision biases perception towards prior beliefs. The challenge of optimal perception involves inferring the causes of sensory inputs. This task is complicated by the inherent ambiguity in sensory inputs, where different causes can generate identical sensations, leading to the "inverse problem" of perception. Resolving this problem requires prior beliefs about the generation of sensations. Additionally, it is necessary to estimate the confidence placed in sensory evidence relative to these prior beliefs. Inaccurate confidence estimation compromises perceptual inference, similar to statistical inference without a proper estimate of standard error. It has been proposed that in autism, high-level prior precision may be attenuated relative to sensory precision, leading to an overemphasis on sensory input and impaired contextualization of sensory information. This suggests that individuals with autism may give disproportionate weight to sensory evidence, driving their beliefs excessively.

In autism, there may be an imbalance in how precision is allocated, with sensory inputs potentially being given too much weight relative to prior beliefs. This can result in a reduced ability to filter out irrelevant sensory information, leading to sensory overload and difficulties in extracting meaningful patterns from the environment. One key application of this framework to autism is in explaining sensory atypicalities. According to Lawson et al. (2017), adults with autism tend to overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment. This can be understood through the lens of active inference as an aberrant precision weighting of sensory inputs. In autism, there may be an overestimation of the unreliability or changeability of sensory information, leading to a constant state of surprise and difficulty in forming stable predictions about the environment. Another important aspect is the idea of context-sensitive modulation of prediction errors. Research suggests that individuals with autism may have difficulties in flexibly adjusting their predictions based on context. This could explain why autistic individuals often struggle with changes in routine or unexpected events, as their predictive models may be less adaptable to changing circumstances. This also can result in difficulties in filtering out irrelevant sensory information, leading to sensory overload and challenges in social interactions. For instance, Pellicano and Burr (2012) suggest that individuals with autism might overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment, which could lead to a constant state of surprise and difficulty in forming stable predictions about social cues and interactions.

Autistic individuals often report both hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli. Coping strategies, including withdrawal from sensory stimulation, can be seen as efforts to avoid excessive prediction errors. This withdrawal resembles the “dark room problem” in predictive coding, where minimizing sensory input can reduce prediction errors. Alternatively, withdrawal might result from the failure to develop internal models necessary for interacting with the world, particularly in social contexts. These behaviors align with neurodevelopmental theories of autism, suggesting that atypical behaviors arise from attempts to balance sensory evidence and top-down beliefs.


**Social Cognition and Predictive Coding**

According to FEP the brain operates as a Bayesian inference machine, constantly updating its internal models to minimize prediction errors. In the context of social cognition, this means accurately predicting others' behaviors and intentions based on social cues. However, individuals with autism may have difficulties in this predictive coding process. They might struggle with the flexible adjustment of predictions based on social context, leading to challenges in interpreting and responding to social cues. This can manifest as difficulties in understanding and predicting others' mental states, a core aspect of social interactions. Furthermore, this framework can help explain the social difficulties often observed in autism. The process of inferring others' mental states and intentions, crucial for social interaction, can be viewed as a form of active inference. Difficulties in this area could be related to atypical precision weighting of social cues or challenges in flexibly updating social predictions.

The enactive-dynamic approach to social cognition, which is compatible with active inference, emphasizes the real-time, fluid, and contextual nature of social interactions. This perspective suggests that social cognition is not just about internal representations but involves continuous interaction with the environment. For individuals with autism, this dynamic interaction may be disrupted due to atypical sensorimotor processing and difficulties in synchronizing with social partners. The enactive-dynamic model highlights how these disruptions can lead to challenges in social understanding and engagement.

It's important to note that while the free energy principle and active inference offer a promising framework for understanding autism, they do not suggest that autism is a deficit or disorder in the traditional sense. Instead, they provide a way to understand the different information processing strategies that may be employed by autistic individuals. By focusing on processes such as precision weighting, prediction error modulation, and adaptive inference, these frameworks offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the diverse manifestations of autism spectrum disorder. This approach not only aligns with existing empirical evidence but also provides a unifying theoretical framework that can guide future research and potentially inform intervention strategies for individuals with autism.

Social interaction presents the greatest uncertainty for individuals with autism, due to the unpredictability of other agents. This unpredictability exacerbates difficulties in social-communication, as it demands precise prior beliefs to contextualize sensory input. Neuroimaging studies on social interaction in autism are sparse, but one study revealed that neurotypical adults show a prediction error-like response in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) when eye gaze behavior violates expectations. Autistic individuals, however, do not exhibit this predictive effect, indicating a failure to anticipate gaze behavior. Another study found that autistic children, when interpreting ironic statements, displayed increased neural activation in regions associated with effortful processing. This increased activity could reflect a struggle to reconcile spoken content with contextual cues, highlighting challenges in contextualizing sensory processing in social interactions.

Cecilia Heyes' concept of Cognitive Gadgets, learned rather than innate cognitive processes, is used to argue that social cognition, including mindreading, is culturally acquired. She supports this with research showing that genetic influence on theory of mind is minimal. Evidence from studies on blindness and childhood maltreatment further suggests that social cognition is heavily dependent on sensory input and environmental factors. Blind children and those who experience maltreatment show higher rates of autism-like symptoms, indicating the importance of sensory and social learning environments in developing social cognition. Thereby, autism might be fundamentally linked to an atypical sensorimotor system, aligning with enactivist views that emphasize the role of sensorimotor processes in cognitive development. Enactivism, therefore, not only offers insights into the autistic experience but also benefits from understanding autism, reinforcing the significance of the sensorimotor system in the broader cognitive landscape.

#### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly impacts individuals who have experienced traumatic events, such as combat veterans, first responders, and abuse survivors. Traditional models often focus narrowly on specific dysfunctions in neurobiology or behavioral patterns. However, a more recent approach using the active inference framework aims to unify these perspectives by reinterpreting neuropsychological dysfunctions, by recasting concepts like executive control, attention, and contextual processing in terms of active inference. The active inference framework puts forward tye need for a generative model that explains PTSD through message passing and belief updating. The framework's explanatory approach involves four interacting levels: embodied-embedded behavioral dynamics, neurobiological substrates, hierarchical Bayesian models of interactions, and psychophysical/phenomenological observations. For instance, under active inference, reward is seen as minimizing expected free energy, with the "fight or flight" response as a survival strategy involving high metabolic expenditure. This response must balance energy allocation to ensure survival against perceived threats.

This approach views PTSD as a maladaptive stress response from an evolutionary perspective, aligning with broader theories of stress and emotion. It emphasizes self-preservation through active inference, where the organism must allocate metabolic resources to avoid existential danger. This alternative perspective on PTSD by reinterprets traditional concepts of top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory control, and attention within an embodied and environmentally embedded neuronal framework. This new perspective also redefines neurocognitive functions such as reality testing, fear generalization, fear extinction, and safety learning. PTSD may cause individuals to adopt maladaptive priors, favoring "fight or flight" or "freeze" responses over exploratory behaviors. These maladaptive priors hinder the usual reality-testing process, preventing the continuous reassessment of the world and reinforcing pathological responses. Physiologically, this impaired belief updating is seen as a form of sensory attenuation, where the precision of sensory signals is covertly reduced. This conserves metabolic energy by limiting sensory processing to higher cortical areas, leading to weakened effective connectivity due to neurochemical imbalances. The PTSD response prioritizes safety, often resulting in a state of heightened threat preparedness. This physiological state change is characterized by a reluctance to explore and confirm an "all clear" signal, perpetuating a self-maintaining threat state. This perspective aligns with known neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral patterns associated with PTSD, offering predictive and construct validity.

Repeated exposure to stressors can lead to changes in the brain's predictive models, resulting in either habituation or sensitization to stress. PTSD can be understood through two main dysfunctions: a heightened bias for interpreting sensory stimuli as existential threats and a compromised ability to reassess these threats. Individuals with PTSD are more likely to perceive neutral stimuli as threats and maintain this perception even when the threat no longer exists. This results in a prolonged threat-response state, which can explain the hyperarousal and low cortisol levels observed in PTSD patients. The neurobiological basis for these dysfunctions involves abnormal neuromodulation, where the brain's mechanisms for encoding sensory precision and processing prediction errors are impaired. Stress can weaken synaptic efficacy and network connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), leading to a reduced ability to process sensory information accurately. This results in a reliance on strong top-down biases, where the brain defaults to threat responses due to inadequate sensory evidence processing. In PTSD, stress-induced impairments prevent the brain leads to lower information transfer and a stronger attraction to the threat-response state. This state inhibits the neurochemical mechanisms necessary to escape the stress response, resulting in a persistent threat perception. Simulation studies support this model, showing that effective neuronal communication relies on synchronized activity, which is disrupted in PTSD. This disruption leads to imprecise sensory processing and an overreliance on threat priors. The amygdala, which is crucial for processing fear and threat-related stimuli, becomes overactive and inhibits the PFC, further impairing the ability to reassess and mitigate perceived threats.

Another key aspect is the concept of aberrant precision weighting, where individuals with PTSD tend to overestimate the precision of threat-related predictions. This results in persistent and exaggerated fear responses even in safe environments, explaining the characteristic hypervigilance and re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD. The strength of applying the free energy principle and active inference to PTSD lies in their ability to recontextualize and integrate a range of empirical evidence. These frameworks offer a predictive model of how sensory-perceptual and cognitive aspects of anxiety may arise, going beyond static belief/filter models often applied in traditional cognitive-behavioral approaches. Similar to anxiety, traumatic experiences can lead to a heightened state of uncertainty and unpredictability, causing the brain to overestimate the likelihood of future threats. This learned uncertainty perpetuates anxiety and stress responses, contributing to the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Stress habituation can also be understood using the free energy principle. We have also mentioned that active inference extends FEP framework by emphasizing the role of action in minimizing free energy. In PTSD, this can manifest as maladaptive explore-exploit dynamics. Individuals may exhibit impaired ability to update their beliefs about environmental safety, leading to either excessive avoidance (over-exploitation of perceived safe behaviors) or risky behaviors (maladaptive exploration) as coping mechanisms. 


The role of precision in predictive coding is central to understanding perception and action in autism. Predictive coding is a neurobiologically plausible model explaining how the brain processes sensory information by generating predictions and comparing them to actual sensory input. Precision, in this context, refers to the gain or excitability of neurons encoding prediction errors, which are discrepancies between expected and actual sensory inputs. High sensory precision, relative to prior beliefs, can lead to an overwhelming focus on sensory details and difficulty integrating broader contextual information.

Autistic perception is often characterized by an intense focus on local details and a lack of central coherence, meaning a difficulty in integrating sensory inputs into a cohesive whole. This results in behaviors such as superior performance on tasks that require focusing on individual parts of a visual stimulus but impairments on tasks that require understanding the overall context. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that individuals with autism exhibit increased activation in visual cortical areas and decreased activation in prefrontal areas during tasks that involve spatial-contextual processing. This suggests heightened bottom-up visual processing and insufficient attenuation of sensory prediction errors.

A failure to appropriately attenuate sensory precision in autism may be due to a lack of sensory attenuation, where sensory prediction errors remain overly precise and context insensitive. This phenomenon can be observed in the diminished adaptive neuronal response to repeated stimuli, known as repetition suppression or adaptation. In autism, this suppression is often less effective, indicating a failure to reduce the precision of prediction errors over repeated exposures. This is also evident in studies of mismatch negativity (MMN) in electroencephalography (EEG), where autistic individuals show atypical responses to repeated and unexpected stimuli.

The effects of heightened sensory precision in autism extend to various perceptual phenomena. For instance, in binocular rivalry, where different images are presented to each eye, autistic individuals experience longer durations of mixed percepts and slower perceptual alternations, suggesting reduced neuronal inhibition and competition among high-level explanations for sensory input. This aligns with the idea that sensory precision outweighs prior beliefs, leading to difficulty in resolving ambiguous sensory inputs.

Visual illusions, which rely on prior expectations to interpret ambiguous sensory information, also highlight differences in perceptual processing in autism. Autistic individuals tend to be less susceptible to certain visual illusions, possibly due to an overemphasis on precise sensory input at the expense of prior contextual knowledge. This reduced susceptibility to illusions can be linked to the high sensory precision observed in autistic perception.

Additionally, the concept of environmental volatility, or fluctuations in the precision of sensory inputs, plays a significant role in adaptive behavior. Computational-fMRI studies have shown that representations of environmental volatility are found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region where structural and functional abnormalities have been reported in autism. Increased activation in the ACC in response to expected but infrequent stimuli suggests a failure to adjust sensory processing based on contextual uncertainty.

In the context of action, the predictive coding framework posits that actions are aimed at minimizing sensory prediction errors. Repetitive behaviors, or "stimming," commonly observed in autism, can be understood as attempts to control sensory input by generating predictable outcomes. This is a coping strategy to manage the overwhelming sensory precision and maintain a sense of control over the environment.

Social interaction, one of the most uncertain and complex aspects of perception, poses significant challenges for individuals with autism. Neuroimaging studies have shown that autistic individuals exhibit atypical responses to social stimuli, such as eye gaze and ironic statements, reflecting a failure to use contextual information to predict and interpret social behavior. This difficulty in social prediction underscores the broader issue of imbalanced sensory precision and prior beliefs in autism.

In summary, the aberrant encoding of precision in predictive coding can explain many features of autistic sensation, perception, and action. The heightened sensory precision relative to prior beliefs leads to difficulties in contextualizing sensory information, resulting in behaviors like sensory overload, repetitive actions, and social-communication challenges. This perspective integrates functional and neurobiological insights, offering a comprehensive understanding of autism's core characteristics and providing a basis for future research and interventions.

#### SUD

The free energy principle (FEP) and active inference framework provide a computational approach to understanding substance use disorder (SUD). These frameworks conceptualize addiction as a disorder of inference and decision-making, where maladaptive behaviors arise from the brain's attempts to minimize free energy through suboptimal models and predictions.

___________________________________

Addiction significantly disrupts the lives of those affected, as addictive behaviors increasingly dominate their time and energy, pushing aside other pursuits and interests. Despite recognizing the negative consequences, addicts often continue their behavior even when it no longer provides pleasure, feeling compelled by a force beyond their control. This situation raises questions about when addiction transitions from being a part of an individual's well-being to becoming harmful and how to distinguish between bad habits and addiction. The authors argue that addiction should be seen as a self-organizing process within an agent-environment system. It becomes harmful when feedback loops lock individuals into destructive behaviors. Addiction is thus rooted in the dynamic interaction between a person and their environment.

The effects of addictive substances on the brain's dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain have been widely studied, leading to the adoption of the "disease model" of addiction. This model suggests that prolonged substance use induces changes in the nervous system, making it difficult for addicts to change their behavior due to dysfunctional reward learning systems. These systems influence various aspects of cognition, emotion, and decision-making, explaining the compulsive nature of drug-seeking behavior and the difficulty in overcoming addiction.

However, according to the predictive processing theory reward is not the cause of action but its consequence. Agents predict rewarding outcomes and choose actions that fulfill these predictions, thus minimizing long-term prediction error. Dopamine is thought to signal the confidence in relevant affordances, which are the opportunities for action available in the environment. Addiction disrupts this process by creating false feedback through substance use, leading addicts to believe they are minimizing error when they are actually increasing it. The predictive processing theory suggests that addiction is not solely a disorder of the brain but a result of disordered interactions within the agent-environment system. The brain, while crucial, is only part of the story. Addiction's harm lies in how it skews the person's ability to attune to relevant affordances in their environment, leading to the neglect of other life aspects. The Predictive Processing theory suggests that addictive behaviors are not passive reactions to sensory cues but are actively driven by the agent's aim to achieve expected future sensory states. This co-dependent relationship between action and perception implies that addicts use substances to maintain a physiological state necessary for homeostasis, similar to feeding a hunger. Addictive cravings are internal processes that sustain the agent's identity, suggesting that the neurocognitive processes in addiction are functioning correctly for a substance-addict. 

In this context, dopamine is posited to signal the precision of affordances, indicating the likelihood of achieving predicted sensory states. In addiction, dopamine's role shifts to confirming high precision for drug-related actions, creating a feedback loop where drug use continually signals successful error reduction, even if illusory. This mechanism drives the addict to seek drugs proactively, reinforcing their behavior through predicted sensory cues associated with drug procurement. The illusion of rapid error reduction through drug use creates a misleading sense of well-being, exacerbating addiction. This repeated behavior trains the agent to expect fast error reduction from drug use, leading to a cycle of seeking the substance to meet these expectations. Cravings are thus seen as the body's response to unmet error reduction rates, compelling the addict to use the drug again. Moreover, addiction causes agents to focus narrowly on drug-related actions, neglecting other important aspects of their lives. This behavior is explained through the concept of a dynamical landscape of attractors, where addicts are locked into fixed-point attractors due to the consistent and predictable outcomes of drug use, even if detrimental. This rigid behavior contrasts with the typical adaptive exploration of uncertain environments for better long-term outcomes.

Agents develop and maintain their identity through biological autonomy, which involves fulfilling predictions about their environment. This identity is sustained by a generative model, an internal hierarchy of predictions that the agent uses to interact with its environment. This model helps the agent bring about predicted sensory inputs, a process termed active inference. In this context, an agent's way of life, including its habits, contributes to maintaining its identity by minimizing unexpected sensory states and avoiding prediction errors.  In addiction, habits and rituals become central to the addict's life, organizing their social and personal world around substance use. The predictability and reliability of substance effects can provide stability in otherwise challenging circumstances. This integration into the addict's identity is profound, making it difficult for them to change without fundamentally altering their sense of self. Substance use often begins within a community context, conferring a sense of belonging, which complicates efforts to quit once addiction sets in.

**Maladaptive Decision-Making**
One of the central insights from applying the FEP to addiction is the understanding of maladaptive decision-making processes. According to Schwartenbeck et al. (2015), addiction can be seen as a shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior. Initially, substance use may be driven by seeking hedonic pleasure (goal-directed behavior), but over time, it transitions to automatic, habitual behavior. This shift can be explained by a change in the brain's inference mechanisms, where the control of behavior moves from action-outcome associations to stimulus-response patterns. This transition is marked by a loss of flexibility and an increase in compulsive drug-seeking behavior, even in the face of negative consequences.
1. Maladaptive decision-making: Active inference models suggest that addiction involves a shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior. Initially, substance use may be driven by seeking pleasure, but over time it transitions to automatic, habitual behavior. This is explained as a change in the brain's inference mechanisms, where behavior control moves from action-outcome associations to stimulus-response patterns, resulting in a loss of flexibility and increase in compulsive drug-seeking behavior.


**Precision Weighting and Reward Processing**
The FEP posits that the brain constantly updates its internal models to minimize prediction errors, which involves assigning precision (confidence) to different sources of information. In the context of SUD, there may be an aberrant precision weighting of reward-related cues. Individuals with addiction might overestimate the precision of drug-related rewards while underestimating the precision of non-drug rewards. This imbalance can lead to a heightened sensitivity to drug-related stimuli and a diminished response to other rewarding experiences. Imaging studies support this by showing changes in reward processing and a loss of phasic dopaminergic responses in addicted individuals, aligning with the reward-deficiency hypothesis.


2. Aberrant precision weighting: In SUDs, there may be an imbalance in how precision (confidence) is assigned to different information sources. Individuals with addiction might overestimate the precision of drug-related rewards while underestimating non-drug rewards. This can lead to heightened sensitivity to drug-related stimuli and diminished response to other rewarding experiences.

**Impulsive and Compulsive Behaviors**
Active inference models suggest that addiction is associated with characteristic patterns of impulsive and compulsive behaviors. Impulsivity in addiction can be understood as a failure to appropriately weigh the long-term consequences of actions, leading to a preference for immediate rewards despite potential negative outcomes. Compulsivity, on the other hand, emerges as a repetitive, habitual response to drug-related cues. These behaviors can be framed within the FEP as maladaptive strategies to minimize free energy, where the brain's predictions and actions become increasingly rigid and less responsive to changing environmental contingencies.

**Impaired learning processes**

Research using active inference models indicates that individuals with SUDs show impairments in learning from both positive and negative outcomes. Specifically:

   - They exhibit less precise action selection mechanisms
   - They have a lower learning rate from losses
   - They have a greater learning rate from gains

**Learning and Adaptation**
Research by Da Costa et al. (2020) using active inference models indicates that individuals with SUD show impairments in learning from both positive and negative outcomes. They exhibit less precise action selection mechanisms and a lower learning rate from losses, which could explain difficulties in adjusting behavior and maintaining optimal decision-making during and after treatment. This suggests that the brain's ability to update its internal models based on new information is compromised in addiction, leading to persistent maladaptive behaviors.

Inconsistent behavior patterns: The findings suggest a pattern of inconsistent behavior in response to positive outcomes in SUDs, combined with a tendency to attribute negative outcomes to chance. Individuals with SUDs fail to settle on a behavior strategy despite sufficient evidence of its success.

**Habit Formation and Maintenance**
The FEP also provides a framework for understanding how habits form and are maintained in addiction. Habits are learned by observing one's own goal-directed behavior and are selected online during active inference. In addiction, the repeated use of substances reinforces habitual responses, making it difficult to break the cycle of addiction. This process involves both explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) behaviors, where the brain seeks to resolve ambiguity and maximize rewards. Over time, the habitual use of substances becomes a dominant strategy for minimizing free energy, even when it is no longer adaptive.



**Conclusion**
The free energy principle and active inference framework offer a comprehensive computational model for understanding substance use disorder. By focusing on maladaptive decision-making processes, aberrant precision weighting, and the transition from goal-directed to habitual behaviors, these frameworks provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying addiction. This approach not only aligns with existing empirical evidence but also offers a unifying theoretical framework that can guide future research and inform intervention strategies to address the complex nature of addiction.
