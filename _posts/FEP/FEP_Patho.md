The free energy principle and active inference framework offer a novel computational perspective for understanding psychiatric disorders, framing them as disorders of inference. This framework provides a unified explanation of how maladaptive beliefs and perceptions can lead to conditions like anxiety and depression by disrupting the brain's ability to minimize uncertainty. In this context here we outline FEP accounts of anxiety and depression. For anxiety, traditional models have emphasized cognitive biases and learned responses, but the free energy principle suggests that anxiety stems from a persistent mismatch between expected and actual outcomes, leading to irreducible uncertainty. Similarly, in depression, the framework explains rumination as a failure in the brain's generative models to effectively reduce uncertainty, leading to persistent negative thought patterns and maladaptive problem-solving strategies. By integrating insights from biological, behavioral, and cognitive theories, the free energy principle and active inference framework provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and treating these mental health conditions, highlighting the importance of addressing learned uncertainty and maladaptive cognitive processes in therapeutic interventions.


#### Anxiety

Traditional models of generalized anxiety suggest that false beliefs and biases lead to heightened and sustained anxiety responses. Early behavioral models focused on conditioning, where anxiety is learned in specific situations, causing anticipatory anxiety upon re-entering similar contexts. Pioneers like Beck and Ellis identified cognitive biases, such as catastrophizing and dualistic thinking, that distort perceptions and exacerbate anxiety. These biases result in a feedback loop where anxiety reinforces itself through misinterpretation of bodily sensations, as seen in Clark's model of panic attacks. While cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been effective in clinical practice, it faces criticism because anxiety symptoms often persist even after erroneous beliefs are addressed.

Several theorists have proposed alternative ways to understand anxiety-related beliefs, challenging traditional models like CBT. Kelly suggested that beliefs are not static but have qualities such as being tight or loose, affecting how they influence perception. Emotion-focused therapies, on the other hand, argue that emotions precede belief formation, and thus anxiety should be understood through the factors that determine emotions. Here we present a new perspective grounded in the free energy principle and active inference, suggesting that anxiety can be re-conceptualized within the framework of working generative models. This view diverges from existing models by focusing on how individuals without initial anxiety may develop anxiety through the process of learning and updating beliefs about uncertainty. 

The proposed approach aims to unify biological, behaviorist, and cognitivist theories by explaining anxiety as a result of bottom-up belief propagation within a systemic optimization framework. This means that rather than seeing anxiety as stemming from fixed erroneous beliefs, it is viewed as a dynamic process where beliefs about uncertainty are continuously updated based on experiences. This model offers a comprehensive understanding of anxiety formation, bridging gaps between various theoretical perspectives and providing a holistic approach to addressing anxiety disorders.

The free energy principle offers a comprehensive framework for understanding anxiety by conceptualizing it as lack of certainty about the effectiveness of actions in reducing uncertainty levels. According to this principle, anxiety arises when there is a persistent mismatch between expected outcomes of actions and the actual outcomes encountered, leading to an irreducible uncertainty about action policies. This sustained uncertainty impairs the system’s ability to develop adaptive models for minimizing expected free energy, resulting in a perception-action cycle dominated by unpredictable outcomes. Consequently, the system learns to expect uncertainty, which in turn reinforces the perception of an unpredictable world. This learned uncertainty is particularly detrimental because it prevents the system from developing adaptive responses, similar to the concept of learned helplessness.

 Biological systems strive to return to a limited number of attracting states to ensure their survival. Hence, the system’s goal remains the minimization of free energy to avoid dissolution into non-characteristic states like death or decay. Therefore, anxiety can be seen as learned uncertainty regarding the sufficiency of the system’s world model and action policies in achieving preferred outcomes. This uncertainty is derived from feedback on the efficacy of action policies in reducing uncertainty. Even though the system continues to attempt minimizing uncertainty, it lacks adaptive methods to do so, as it perceives the world as inherently unpredictable. This perception removes the epistemic affordance of novelty, crucial for resolving uncertainty through expected information gain.

Persistent anxious states, characteristic of anxiety disorders, emerge from the system learning irreducible uncertainty through continuous model updating and action policies. This aligns with experiential accounts of anxiety, where individuals with anxiety disorders perceive the world as unsafe and unpredictable, in contrast to those with lower anxiety levels who view the world as safe and trustworthy. A biological system with a history of persistent uncertainty is likely to expect ambiguous feedback about the effectiveness of its world model and action policies in reducing future uncertainty. This expectation persists regardless of whether the actual uncertainty is reducible, leading to a disproportionate perception of uncertainty. Thus, the system learns that its model and action policies are insufficient for minimizing uncertainty, resulting in the psychological experience of generalized anxiety.

From an affective or emotional inference perspective, anxiety can be understood as part of the generative model that best explains the state of affairs. The experience of anxiety reflects the system’s recognition of its state of uncertainty, manifesting as the thought, “I must be anxious because I cannot decide what to do.” Therefore, experienced anxiety indicates that the biological system has sufficiently expressive generative models to acknowledge its uncertainty. This approach unifies the understanding of anxiety by explaining how continuous exposure to uncertain outcomes leads to a persistent state of learned uncertainty, ultimately resulting in anxiety disorders.

Understanding anxiety through the lens of the free energy principle involves examining how the brain forms hierarchical models to predict and interpret sensory data. These hierarchical models, described as deep temporal models, operate on different levels where lower-level models handle immediate sensory inputs and higher-level models integrate these inputs over time to infer broader contexts. Anxiety emerges when there is a persistent mismatch between predicted and actual outcomes, leading to a state of irreducible uncertainty about the effectiveness of one's actions.

In hierarchical modeling, lower-level models process immediate observations while higher-level models integrate these observations to form more stable beliefs over time. For instance, if an agent continuously experiences unpredictable outcomes they receive feedback that their current models are inadequate for reliably predicting outcomes. This leads to a situation where the agent becomes uncertain about the utility of their action policies. This learned uncertainty disrupts the agent's ability to develop adaptive responses, resulting in a cycle where the agent continually perceives the world as unpredictable, which is a foundational aspect of anxiety disorders.

This process can be understood through Bayesian learning, where the brain updates its beliefs based on new information. When an agent's experiences consistently indicate that their actions do not lead to predictable outcomes, the agent's higher-level models adapt to this perceived unpredictability. This creates a belief system where uncertainty becomes a central feature, even if the actual world is not as unpredictable as the agent perceives it to be. Consequently, the agent develops anxious beliefs that persistently expect uncertainty, which interferes with their ability to respond adaptively to new situations.

Persistent uncertainty is a well-documented precursor to anxiety. Research shows that early experiences of unpredictability can lead to more severe anxiety symptoms later in life. This suggests that initial exposure to uncertainty can shape how an individual's brain models the world, leading to a long-term expectation of unpredictability. These early experiences set the stage for the development of generalized anxiety, where the individual continually perceives and reacts to the world as if it were inherently uncertain.

Distinguishing between accurately modeling a truly uncertain world and inaccurately modeling a certain world is crucial. In some cases, the world genuinely is uncertain, and modeling this accurately does not necessarily lead to anxiety. However, anxiety arises when the brain inaccurately models the world as uncertain even when it is not. This misalignment occurs when the brain's models persistently expect uncertainty due to prior experiences, leading to a new state of homeostasis based on learned uncertainty. This pathological state causes the individual to behave as if the world is uncertain, even when it becomes more predictable. Although the model described simplifies the complex processes involved in anxiety formation, it highlights the importance of how the brain differentiates between internal and external states. This differentiation, known as the Markov blanket, is crucial for understanding how the brain's internal models interact with external realities. Future research will need to delve deeper into these interoceptive aspects to fully understand anxiety.

#### Depression
The free energy principle has been proposed as a unifying framework where depression emerges from a collection of depressive beliefs or distorted representations of the world, particularly related to reward representation. Rumination involves repetitive and often unproductive thoughts about one’s mood, problems, and their origins, which typically leads to a depressed mood and hampers problem-solving. This persistent mental state can lead to mental disorders like major depression. Despite extensive research and various models explaining rumination, its exact function remains unclear. 

The active inference framework helps explain how rumination, a key aspect of MDD and a marker for comorbidity between depression and anxiety, can lead to pathologies by disrupting the brain's ability to minimize uncertainty. Rumination's process is explained through the brain's use of hierarchical generative models. These models are structured in layers, where lower layers process immediate sensory input and higher layers integrate this information to form broader predictions. This hierarchical structure allows the brain to make predictions about state transitions over time. Mental simulation, or "running imaginary actions," plays a crucial role in this process, enabling the brain to optimize generative models without overt action. This involves evaluating policies (sequences of actions) based on their expected ability to reduce uncertainty and make accurate predictions.

In the context of rumination, distortions in mental simulation can lead to excessive and maladaptive thinking patterns. The process of mental simulation is divided into three steps: generating candidates for simulation from possible experiences, choosing a candidate to focus on, and utilizing the chosen candidate to reduce prediction errors through mental problem-solving. Distortions in any of these steps can result in depressive rumination. Active inference suggests that the brain constructs internal models to predict vital parameters essential for survival, creating "self-fulfilling prophecies" through its actions. In the case of rumination, the brain fails to update its models adaptively, leading to persistent uncertainty and anxiety. This framework emphasizes the importance of understanding rumination not just as a maladaptive cognitive process but as a disruption in the brain’s ability to optimize its generative models, this perspective provides a comprehensive explanation for how rumination develops and persists, leading to depression and other mental disorders.

Several factors contribute to this unsuccessful mental problem-solving, resulting in stabilized rumination. First, the high computational complexity of real-world problems, especially interpersonal and social situations, makes them difficult to solve. Depressed individuals may struggle to approximate solutions due to the high computational demands required for such complex tasks. Additionally, the complex nature of problems involved in rumination often demands unrealistic precision, making perfect solutions unattainable and prolonging rumination. Traumatic events, sorrow, and anxiety can exacerbate this demand for precision.

Likewise, depressed individuals might overestimate losses and prematurely discard potentially successful paths due to initial minor losses. This results in fewer options being pursued. Furthermore, missing action policies due to limited experiences increase computational efforts and restrict the number of viable solutions. Biases in policy selection further contribute to prolonged rumination. Learned helplessness occurs when repeated failures lead individuals to conclude that uncertainty cannot be resolved, reducing their engagement in problem-solving. This shifts their belief system, making them less likely to pursue deeper mental exploration. The lack of alternative behavioral policies due to the generative model’s poor fit reduces the estimated pragmatic value of actions, making individuals less likely to engage in new behaviors. This imbalance leads to more candidate sampling rather than actual problem-solving. As, the process of sampling policy candidates can also be biased and intercorrelated, yielding limited and repetitive policy options. Depressed individuals often remain in similar physical and emotional states, leading to repetitive sampling of similar policy candidates. This feedback loop reduces the likelihood of finding effective solutions. Additionally, poor model fit and inefficient action policies result in less informative sensory data, exacerbating rumination by relying more on cognitively generated prediction errors.

Long-term rumination has several negative consequences such opportunity costs it brings about, as neither pragmatic nor epistemic value is mined during depressive rumination. This leads to a decline in behavioral output and general model fit, creating a vicious cycle where biases intensify over time. The brain’s continuous optimization of its knowledge structure can make ruminative states a default response, hindering effective problem-solving and reducing intrinsic motivation. Rumination also distorts both experiential and narrative self-perceptions, making it difficult to update with new information and perpetuating negative self-perceptions. This distorted narrative self influences hyperpriors over candidates for thought, further entrenching ruminative patterns.


As a treatment framework along these lines to avoid repetitive sampling, therapists should consider the context, mood, or bodily states during problem-solving. Activities like endurance training can reduce rumination by promoting neurogenesis, integrating the emotional flanker task with CBT helps patients shift attention away from negative thought patterns. Along the same lines, metacognitive and acceptance and commitment therapies have shown promise by guiding cognitive processes and goal setting based on personal values. Explicitly incorporating problem complexity estimations and analyzing the costs and benefits of mental engagement can further refine treatments. Patients should learn to predict the time and benefits of solving problems through mental simulation compared to overt actions. It is also important to highlight the shared etiology between MDD and anxiety disorders, with rumination being a common factor. Thus, the proposed improvements for treating rumination in MDD could be beneficial for other psychiatric conditions, such as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Preventing excessive rumination should be a key therapeutic target across various psychological disorders.




The free energy principle and active inference framework provide a computational account for understanding various psychiatric disorders as disorders of inference. Here are some examples from the scientific literature on how this framework can be applied to psychiatric disorders:


#### Schizophrenia
According to the active inference framework, symptoms like hallucinations or delusions in schizophrenia can be explained as resulting from false inferences about the causes of sensory inputs [1][2]. Specifically, an aberrant regulation of the precision parameter, which weights sensory evidence against prior beliefs, can lead to hallucinations if unreliable sensory data is given too much precision compared to prior beliefs [2].

#### Autism Spectrum Disorder  
The active inference view suggests that the core deficit in autism may be a failure to attenuate or suppress the precision of sensory evidence for self-produced actions (sensory attenuation) [1][2]. This could explain symptoms like hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli and difficulties with coherence and integration of information in autism.


#### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly impacts individuals who have experienced traumatic events, such as combat veterans, first responders, and abuse survivors. Traditional models often focus narrowly on specific dysfunctions in neurobiology or behavioral patterns. However, a more recent approach using the active inference framework aims to unify these perspectives by reinterpreting neuropsychological dysfunctions, by recasting concepts like executive control, attention, and contextual processing in terms of active inference. The active inference framework puts forward tye need for a generative model that explains PTSD through message passing and belief updating. The framework's explanatory approach involves four interacting levels: embodied-embedded behavioral dynamics, neurobiological substrates, hierarchical Bayesian models of interactions, and psychophysical/phenomenological observations. For instance, under active inference, reward is seen as minimizing expected free energy, with the "fight or flight" response as a survival strategy involving high metabolic expenditure. This response must balance energy allocation to ensure survival against perceived threats.

This approach views PTSD as a maladaptive stress response from an evolutionary perspective, aligning with broader theories of stress and emotion. It emphasizes self-preservation through active inference, where the organism must allocate metabolic resources to avoid existential danger. This alternative perspective on PTSD by reinterprets traditional concepts of top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory control, and attention within an embodied and environmentally embedded neuronal framework. This new perspective also redefines neurocognitive functions such as reality testing, fear generalization, fear extinction, and safety learning. PTSD may cause individuals to adopt maladaptive priors, favoring "fight or flight" or "freeze" responses over exploratory behaviors. These maladaptive priors hinder the usual reality-testing process, preventing the continuous reassessment of the world and reinforcing pathological responses. Physiologically, this impaired belief updating is seen as a form of sensory attenuation, where the precision of sensory signals is covertly reduced. This conserves metabolic energy by limiting sensory processing to higher cortical areas, leading to weakened effective connectivity due to neurochemical imbalances. The PTSD response prioritizes safety, often resulting in a state of heightened threat preparedness. This physiological state change is characterized by a reluctance to explore and confirm an "all clear" signal, perpetuating a self-maintaining threat state. This perspective aligns with known neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral patterns associated with PTSD, offering predictive and construct validity.








PTSD can be understood through two main dysfunctions: a heightened bias for interpreting sensory stimuli as existential threats and a compromised ability to reassess these threats. Individuals with PTSD are more likely to perceive neutral stimuli as threats and maintain this perception even when the threat no longer exists. This results in a prolonged threat-response state, which can explain the hyperarousal and low cortisol levels observed in PTSD patients.

The neurobiological basis for these dysfunctions involves abnormal neuromodulation, where the brain's mechanisms for encoding sensory precision and processing prediction errors are impaired. Stress can weaken synaptic efficacy and network connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), leading to a reduced ability to process sensory information accurately. This results in a reliance on strong top-down biases, where the brain defaults to threat responses due to inadequate sensory evidence processing.

Healthy brain function is associated with gamma-frequency rhythms that facilitate efficient neuronal communication. In PTSD, stress-induced impairments prevent the brain from achieving these rhythms, leading to lower information transfer and a stronger attraction to the threat-response state. This state inhibits the neurochemical mechanisms necessary to escape the stress response, resulting in a persistent threat perception.

Simulation studies support this model, showing that effective neuronal communication relies on synchronized activity, which is disrupted in PTSD. This disruption leads to imprecise sensory processing and an overreliance on threat priors. The amygdala, which is crucial for processing fear and threat-related stimuli, becomes overactive and inhibits the PFC, further impairing the ability to reassess and mitigate perceived threats.

Experiments have shown that PTSD flashbacks are associated with reduced visuospatial processing, highlighting the impaired sensory sampling and integration in PTSD patients. This integrative model aligns with clinical observations of PTSD and offers a comprehensive understanding of its neurobiological and cognitive underpinnings, bridging the gap between biology and behavioral phenomena.





In the context of PTSD, the free energy principle suggests that traumatic experiences lead to maladaptive predictions and heightened stress responses. One key aspect is the concept of aberrant precision weighting, where individuals with PTSD tend to overestimate the precision of threat-related predictions. This results in persistent and exaggerated fear responses even in safe environments, explaining the characteristic hypervigilance and re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD. The strength of applying the free energy principle and active inference to PTSD lies in their ability to recontextualize and integrate a range of empirical evidence. These frameworks offer a predictive model of how sensory-perceptual and cognitive aspects of anxiety may arise, going beyond static belief/filter models often applied in traditional cognitive-behavioral approaches.


Active inference extends this framework by emphasizing the role of action in minimizing free energy. In PTSD, this can manifest as maladaptive explore-exploit dynamics. Individuals may exhibit impaired ability to update their beliefs about environmental safety, leading to either excessive avoidance (over-exploitation of perceived safe behaviors) or risky behaviors (maladaptive exploration) as coping mechanisms.

Similar to anxiety, traumatic experiences can lead to a heightened state of uncertainty and unpredictability, causing the brain to overestimate the likelihood of future threats. This learned uncertainty perpetuates anxiety and stress responses, contributing to the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms.

Stress habituation can also be understood using the free energy principle. Repeated exposure to stressors can lead to changes in the brain's predictive models, resulting in either habituation or sensitization to stress. In PTSD, the failure to habituate to stress may be due to an inability to update predictive models appropriately, leading to persistent stress responses and maladaptive coping strategies.
