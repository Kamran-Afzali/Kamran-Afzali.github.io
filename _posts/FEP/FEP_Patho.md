The free energy principle and active inference framework provide a computational account for understanding various psychiatric disorders as disorders of inference. Here are some examples from the scientific literature on how this framework can be applied to psychiatric disorders:

## Schizophrenia
According to the active inference framework, symptoms like hallucinations or delusions in schizophrenia can be explained as resulting from false inferences about the causes of sensory inputs [1][2]. Specifically, an aberrant regulation of the precision parameter, which weights sensory evidence against prior beliefs, can lead to hallucinations if unreliable sensory data is given too much precision compared to prior beliefs [2].

## Autism Spectrum Disorder  
The active inference view suggests that the core deficit in autism may be a failure to attenuate or suppress the precision of sensory evidence for self-produced actions (sensory attenuation) [1][2]. This could explain symptoms like hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli and difficulties with coherence and integration of information in autism.

## Depression
The free energy principle has been proposed as a unifying framework for understanding depression [3]. Within this view, depression emerges from a collection of depressive beliefs or distorted representations of the world, particularly related to reward representation. Antidepressants may help by correcting these distorted representations, while psychotherapy attempts to optimize actions to break cycles of self-defeating behavior stemming from the depressive beliefs.

## Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Active inference has been used to model the pathophysiology of PTSD [4]. The core idea is that in PTSD, sparse sensory samples confirm an overly strong prior belief about threat, inducing a sustained stress response state. This corresponds to the notion of "underfitting" in machine learning, where sensory data is given insufficient weight compared to prior beliefs.

In summary, by casting psychiatric conditions as disorders of inference about states of the world or body, the free energy principle and active inference allow for a unified computational understanding linking symptoms to putative underlying mechanisms like aberrant precision weighting. This formal framework provides a way to connect empirical findings across different disorders.
