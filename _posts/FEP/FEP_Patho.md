The free energy principle and active inference framework provide a computational account for understanding various psychiatric disorders as disorders of inference. Here are some examples from the scientific literature on how this framework can be applied to psychiatric disorders:

#### Anxiety

Traditional models of generalized anxiety suggest that false beliefs and biases lead to heightened and sustained anxiety responses. Early behavioral models focused on conditioning, where anxiety is learned in specific situations, causing anticipatory anxiety upon re-entering similar contexts. Pioneers like Beck and Ellis identified cognitive biases, such as catastrophizing and dualistic thinking, that distort perceptions and exacerbate anxiety. These biases result in a feedback loop where anxiety reinforces itself through misinterpretation of bodily sensations, as seen in Clark's model of panic attacks. While cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been effective in clinical practice, it faces criticism because anxiety symptoms often persist even after erroneous beliefs are addressed.

Several theorists have proposed alternative ways to understand anxiety-related beliefs, challenging traditional models like CBT. Kelly suggested that beliefs are not static but have qualities such as being tight or loose, affecting how they influence perception. Emotion-focused therapies, on the other hand, argue that emotions precede belief formation, and thus anxiety should be understood through the factors that determine emotions. Here we present a new perspective grounded in the free energy principle and active inference, suggesting that anxiety can be re-conceptualized within the framework of working generative models. This view diverges from existing models by focusing on how individuals without initial anxiety may develop anxiety through the process of learning and updating beliefs about uncertainty. 

The proposed approach aims to unify biological, behaviorist, and cognitivist theories by explaining anxiety as a result of bottom-up belief propagation within a systemic optimization framework. This means that rather than seeing anxiety as stemming from fixed erroneous beliefs, it is viewed as a dynamic process where beliefs about uncertainty are continuously updated based on experiences. This model offers a comprehensive understanding of anxiety formation, bridging gaps between various theoretical perspectives and providing a holistic approach to addressing anxiety disorders.

The free energy principle offers a comprehensive framework for understanding anxiety by conceptualizing it as lack of certainty about the effectiveness of actions in reducing uncertainty levels. According to this principle, anxiety arises when there is a persistent mismatch between expected outcomes of actions and the actual outcomes encountered, leading to an irreducible uncertainty about action policies. This sustained uncertainty impairs the system’s ability to develop adaptive models for minimizing expected free energy, resulting in a perception-action cycle dominated by unpredictable outcomes. Consequently, the system learns to expect uncertainty, which in turn reinforces the perception of an unpredictable world. This learned uncertainty is particularly detrimental because it prevents the system from developing adaptive responses, similar to the concept of learned helplessness.

 Biological systems strive to return to a limited number of attracting states to ensure their survival. Hence, the system’s goal remains the minimization of free energy to avoid dissolution into non-characteristic states like death or decay. Therefore, anxiety can be seen as learned uncertainty regarding the sufficiency of the system’s world model and action policies in achieving preferred outcomes. This uncertainty is derived from feedback on the efficacy of action policies in reducing uncertainty. Even though the system continues to attempt minimizing uncertainty, it lacks adaptive methods to do so, as it perceives the world as inherently unpredictable. This perception removes the epistemic affordance of novelty, crucial for resolving uncertainty through expected information gain.

Persistent anxious states, characteristic of anxiety disorders, emerge from the system learning irreducible uncertainty through continuous model updating and action policies. This aligns with experiential accounts of anxiety, where individuals with anxiety disorders perceive the world as unsafe and unpredictable, in contrast to those with lower anxiety levels who view the world as safe and trustworthy. A biological system with a history of persistent uncertainty is likely to expect ambiguous feedback about the effectiveness of its world model and action policies in reducing future uncertainty. This expectation persists regardless of whether the actual uncertainty is reducible, leading to a disproportionate perception of uncertainty. Thus, the system learns that its model and action policies are insufficient for minimizing uncertainty, resulting in the psychological experience of generalized anxiety.

From an affective or emotional inference perspective, anxiety can be understood as part of the generative model that best explains the state of affairs. The experience of anxiety reflects the system’s recognition of its state of uncertainty, manifesting as the thought, “I must be anxious because I cannot decide what to do.” Therefore, experienced anxiety indicates that the biological system has sufficiently expressive generative models to acknowledge its uncertainty. This approach unifies the understanding of anxiety by explaining how continuous exposure to uncertain outcomes leads to a persistent state of learned uncertainty, ultimately resulting in anxiety disorders.

Understanding anxiety through the lens of the free energy principle involves examining how the brain forms hierarchical models to predict and interpret sensory data. These hierarchical models, described as deep temporal models, operate on different levels where lower-level models handle immediate sensory inputs and higher-level models integrate these inputs over time to infer broader contexts. Anxiety emerges when there is a persistent mismatch between predicted and actual outcomes, leading to a state of irreducible uncertainty about the effectiveness of one's actions.

In hierarchical modeling, lower-level models process immediate observations while higher-level models integrate these observations to form more stable beliefs over time. For instance, if an agent continuously experiences unpredictable outcomes they receive feedback that their current models are inadequate for reliably predicting outcomes. This leads to a situation where the agent becomes uncertain about the utility of their action policies. This learned uncertainty disrupts the agent's ability to develop adaptive responses, resulting in a cycle where the agent continually perceives the world as unpredictable, which is a foundational aspect of anxiety disorders.

This process can be understood through Bayesian learning, where the brain updates its beliefs based on new information. When an agent's experiences consistently indicate that their actions do not lead to predictable outcomes, the agent's higher-level models adapt to this perceived unpredictability. This creates a belief system where uncertainty becomes a central feature, even if the actual world is not as unpredictable as the agent perceives it to be. Consequently, the agent develops anxious beliefs that persistently expect uncertainty, which interferes with their ability to respond adaptively to new situations.

Persistent uncertainty is a well-documented precursor to anxiety. Research shows that early experiences of unpredictability can lead to more severe anxiety symptoms later in life. This suggests that initial exposure to uncertainty can shape how an individual's brain models the world, leading to a long-term expectation of unpredictability. These early experiences set the stage for the development of generalized anxiety, where the individual continually perceives and reacts to the world as if it were inherently uncertain.

Distinguishing between accurately modeling a truly uncertain world and inaccurately modeling a certain world is crucial. In some cases, the world genuinely is uncertain, and modeling this accurately does not necessarily lead to anxiety. However, anxiety arises when the brain inaccurately models the world as uncertain even when it is not. This misalignment occurs when the brain's models persistently expect uncertainty due to prior experiences, leading to a new state of homeostasis based on learned uncertainty. This pathological state causes the individual to behave as if the world is uncertain, even when it becomes more predictable. Although the model described simplifies the complex processes involved in anxiety formation, it highlights the importance of how the brain differentiates between internal and external states. This differentiation, known as the Markov blanket, is crucial for understanding how the brain's internal models interact with external realities. Future research will need to delve deeper into these interoceptive aspects to fully understand anxiety.



#### Schizophrenia
According to the active inference framework, symptoms like hallucinations or delusions in schizophrenia can be explained as resulting from false inferences about the causes of sensory inputs [1][2]. Specifically, an aberrant regulation of the precision parameter, which weights sensory evidence against prior beliefs, can lead to hallucinations if unreliable sensory data is given too much precision compared to prior beliefs [2].

#### Autism Spectrum Disorder  
The active inference view suggests that the core deficit in autism may be a failure to attenuate or suppress the precision of sensory evidence for self-produced actions (sensory attenuation) [1][2]. This could explain symptoms like hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli and difficulties with coherence and integration of information in autism.

#### Depression
The free energy principle has been proposed as a unifying framework for understanding depression [3]. Within this view, depression emerges from a collection of depressive beliefs or distorted representations of the world, particularly related to reward representation. Antidepressants may help by correcting these distorted representations, while psychotherapy attempts to optimize actions to break cycles of self-defeating behavior stemming from the depressive beliefs.

#### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Active inference has been used to model the pathophysiology of PTSD [4]. The core idea is that in PTSD, sparse sensory samples confirm an overly strong prior belief about threat, inducing a sustained stress response state. This corresponds to the notion of "underfitting" in machine learning, where sensory data is given insufficient weight compared to prior beliefs.

In summary, by casting psychiatric conditions as disorders of inference about states of the world or body, the free energy principle and active inference allow for a unified computational understanding linking symptoms to putative underlying mechanisms like aberrant precision weighting. This formal framework provides a way to connect empirical findings across different disorders.
