## Active Inference Account of Defense mechanisms 

In psychoanalysis, defense mechanisms are understood as unconscious strategies employed by the ego to protect itself from distressing or conflicting thoughts and feelings. These mechanisms, such as repression, denial, and projection, operate by distorting or blocking awareness of unacceptable impulses or traumatic memories. The alignment between active inference/FEP and defense mechanisms in psychoanalysis offers a new way of understanding how the mind manages conflict and maintains stability. The FEP provides a computational explanation for why defense mechanisms are used, and how they can become entrenched over time and also how they can be addressed in therapy. **By viewing defense mechanisms as active inferences aimed at minimizing prediction error, the FEP framework provides a bridge between the language of psychoanalysis and modern cognitive neuroscience**. From an FEP perspective, these mechanisms are not seen as dysfunctions but as adaptive processes that minimize surprise and maintain a stable model of the world by modifying the way the mind processes information. In this view, the brain is constantly predicting the causes of its sensations, and defense mechanisms are a way of altering predictions to reduce the experience of surprise or uncertainty. The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and defense mechanisms in psychoanalysis offers a compelling perspective on how the mind manages internal conflict and maintains stability. While traditional psychoanalytic theory describes defense mechanisms as primarily driven by the ego to avoid anxiety, the FEP provides a computational framework for understanding these processes as strategies to minimize prediction errors, resolve uncertainty, and maintain a coherent model of the world. **In essence, the FEP views defense mechanisms not merely as ways to avoid unpleasant feelings, but as active inferences aimed at reducing the brain's overall free energy.**


**Defense mechanisms are not static; they are learned and shaped by experience**. The FEP suggests that these mechanisms are constraints on the future development of the generative models. In other words, if a particular defense mechanism has been successful at reducing prediction error, the brain is likely to rely on it again in similar situations. This can lead to rigid patterns of behavior and thought that are resistant to change, which can be seen as contributing to psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the brain can become trapped in a self-sustaining pattern of behavior if the priors associated with defensive responses become too entrenched. Along these lines, the FEP framework implies that defense mechanisms are not always maladaptive. In many cases, they may serve a necessary function of protecting the individual from overwhelming emotions or conflicts. However, when these mechanisms become too rigid or pervasive, they can limit a person's capacity for adaptation and growth. **Therapy, from this perspective, becomes a process of reducing the precision of these defensive responses to allow the individual to experience and integrate previously avoided feelings and thoughts**. In essence, the therapeutic process allows for a re-evaluation of previously suppressed representations by creating a safe environment where the client can explore and reduce the rigidity of their existing priors.

The relationship between active inference and defense mechanisms is an emerging area of inquiry that bridges cognitive neuroscience, psychoanalysis, and predictive coding theories. Active inference, a principle grounded in the free energy framework, provides a computational and neurobiological account of how organisms minimize uncertainty and maintain homeostasis.  Connolly (2018) extends this idea by formalizing conflict and defense mechanisms within the expected free energy framework. Expected free energy accounts for the future-oriented nature of decision-making, emphasizing the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation in belief updating. Defense mechanisms, in this context, act as regulatory processes that guide individuals toward maintaining a stable sense of self and avoiding states of high uncertainty. For instance, projection, a defense mechanism where an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts to others, can be seen as an active inference strategy that externalizes uncertainty to preserve internal stability.



The regulation of inhibitory control within the prefrontal networks offers further insights into the neurocomputational basis of defense mechanisms. Depue et al. (2015) have demonstrated that common inhibitory mechanisms govern cognitive, emotional, and motor processes. This suggests that defense mechanisms may rely on the same neural circuitry that underlies other forms of regulatory control. From an active inference perspective, these inhibitory processes function to suppress prediction errors associated with negative emotional states, thus facilitating psychological stability. Along the same lines, Gray et al. (2013) have investigated the neural correlates of conscious conflict, revealing that sustaining incompatible intentions engages prefrontal networks involved in cognitive control. This research supports the idea that defense mechanisms, particularly those related to internal conflict, are deeply intertwined with executive functioning. The ability to manage conflicting predictions, as seen in repression and rationalization, may be critical for reducing cognitive dissonance and minimizing free energy.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, **repression** is a defense mechanism in which a person unconsciously blocks unacceptable thoughts or memories from entering conscious awareness. In the FEP framework, this can be understood as a process of assigning low precision to the suppressed representation, making it less likely to be activated, thereby reducing the prediction error associated with that particular thought or memory. In a sense, the brain predicts that the **suppressed memory should not enter consciousness, thereby minimizing the surprise that would occur if it did**.

The alignment between active inference/the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and **projective identification** in psychoanalysis provides a framework for understanding how individuals shape their environments to fit their internal models. In psychoanalysis, **projective identification is a process where a person projects their own unwanted thoughts or feelings onto another person, who then unconsciously embodies those projections**. From an active inference perspective, this can be seen as an attempt to reduce prediction error by creating a world that confirms one's expectations.

Active inference suggests that the brain continuously attempts to minimize its free energy by either changing its internal models or influencing the external world. **Projective identification can be understood as a strategy where, instead of changing internal models, an individual manipulates their environment, particularly interpersonal relationships, to align with pre-existing beliefs**. For example, someone who anticipates being abandoned may unconsciously provoke others to leave them, thereby confirming their expectation. From the FEP perspective, **projective identification is an entrenched "prior," inaccessible to updating via active inference**. Instead of revising priors in the light of experience, the individual attempts to shape the interpersonal world in the light of pre-existing phantasies. **In the therapeutic setting, projective identification can manifest in the relationship between therapist and client**. For example, a therapist might "forget" to inform a client about an upcoming break because they have been unconsciously induced by the client's expectation of abandonment. In this way, the therapist is not interpreting the meaning of the projective identification directly, but rather uses it as an opportunity to design experiments to help the client disambiguate their hypotheses about why they behave in the ways that they do.
