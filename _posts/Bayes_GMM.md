Mixture modeling is a powerful technique for integrating multiple data generating processes into a single model. Unfortunately when those data data generating processes are degenerate the resulting mixture model suffers from inherent combinatorial non-identifiabilities that frustrate accurate computation. Consequently, in order to utilize mixture models reliably in practice we need strong and principled prior information to ameliorate these frustrations.

In this case study I will first introduce how mixture models are implemented in Bayesian inference. I will then discuss the non-identifiability inherent to that construction as well as how the non-identifiability can be tempered with principled prior information. Lastly I will demonstrate how these issues manifest in a simple example, with a final tangent to consider an additional pathology that can arise in Bayesian mixture models.


Michael [Betancourt](https://maggielieu.com/2017/03/21/multivariate-gaussian-mixture-model-done-properly/) recently wrote a nice case study describing the problems often encountered with gaussian mixture models, specifically the estimation of parameters of a mixture model and identifiability i.e. the problem with labelling mixtures (http://mc-stan.org/documentation/case-studies/identifying_mixture_models.html). Also there has been suggestions that GMM’s can’t be easily done in Stan. I’ve found various examples online of simple 2d gaussian mixtures, and one (wrong) example of a Multivariate GMM. I wanted to demonstrate that Stan can actually do Multivariate GMM’s and very quickly! But as Mike’s already discussed problems with identifiability are still inherent in the model.


Bayesian mixture models can be implemented in Stan, a probabilistic programming language. Mixture models assume that a given measurement can be drawn from one of K data generating processes, each with their own set of parameters. Stan allows for the fitting of Bayesian mixture models using its state-of-the-art Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. The models can be parameterized in several ways and used directly for modeling data with multimodal distributions or as priors for other parameters[1][2]. The implementation of mixture models in Stan involves defining the model, specifying the priors, and marginalizing out the discrete parameters. Several resources provide examples and tutorials on fitting Bayesian mixture models in Stan, demonstrating the practical implementation of these models[3][4][5].


The advantages of using Bayesian mixture models include:

1. **Flexibility**: Bayesian mixture models are flexible and can accommodate complex data structures, making them suitable for tasks such as clustering, data compression, outlier detection, or generative classifiers[5].

2. **Incorporating Prior Knowledge**: The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge into the modeling framework, which can be particularly useful when such information is available[4].

3. **Handling Unobserved Heterogeneity**: Mixture models are effective in handling unobserved heterogeneity in data, where the data alone may not fully identify the underlying processes. Bayesian mixture models can integrate multiple data generating processes into a single model, making them valuable in cases where the data alone don't allow full identification of the processes[3].

4. **Stability and Posterior Inference**: Bayesian estimation provides stable posterior distributions, which are less sensitive to singularities, over-fitting, and violated identification compared to maximum likelihood estimation. This stability allows for a more reliable inference about the model parameters[2].

5. **Examination of Class Structure**: Bayesian mixture models allow for the examination of the posterior distribution of the number of classes, providing insights into the underlying class structure of the data[2].

The limitations of using Bayesian mixture models include:

1. **Statistical Expertise Requirement**: A high level of statistical expertise is required to ensure that appropriate priors are used, and the model is correctly specified. This can be a challenge for practitioners without a strong background in Bayesian statistics[3].

2. **Posterior Inference Complexity**: Posterior inference of mixtures can be complicated by label switching, which refers to the non-identifiability of the different components in the mixture model. This can make it challenging to interpret the results and make posterior inference more complex[3].

3. **Inconsistency in the Number of Clusters**: Bayesian nonparametric mixture models may suffer from inconsistency in the number of clusters, especially when using certain priors. This means that the number of clusters may not be accurately estimated, which can impact the model's performance, particularly in clustering applications[4].

4. **Model Fitting Challenges**: Mixture models may struggle to fit certain types of data, and the inaccuracies in the model's predictions need to be carefully evaluated and compared with competing models[5].

While Bayesian mixture models offer many advantages, it is important to consider these limitations when applying them to real-world data analysis tasks.


In this chapter, we learned to fit increasingly complex two-component mixture models using Stan, starting with a simple model and ending with a fully hierarchical model. We saw how to evaluate model fit using the usual prior and posterior predictive checks, and to investigate parameter recovery. Such mixture models are notoriously difficult to fit, but they have a lot of potential in cognitive science applications, especially in developing computational models of different kinds of cognitive processes.

The reader interested in a deeper understanding of marginalization is referred to Pullin, Gurrin, and Vukcevic (2021). Betancourt discusses problems of identification in Bayesian mixture models in a case study ( https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/identifying_mixture_models.html). An in-depth treatment of the fast-guess model and other mixture models of response times is provided in Chapter 7 of Luce (1991).
