Mixture modeling is a powerful technique for integrating multiple data generating processes into a single model. Unfortunately when those data data generating processes are degenerate the resulting mixture model suffers from inherent combinatorial non-identifiabilities that frustrate accurate computation. Consequently, in order to utilize mixture models reliably in practice we need strong and principled prior information to ameliorate these frustrations. 

Bayesian mixture models can be implemented in Stan, a probabilistic programming language. Mixture models assume that a given measurement can be drawn from one of K data generating processes, each with their own set of parameters. Stan allows for the fitting of Bayesian mixture models using its Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. The models can be parameterized in several ways and used directly for modeling data with multimodal distributions or as priors for other parameters. The implementation of mixture models in Stan involves defining the model, specifying the priors, and marginalizing out the discrete parameters. Several resources provide examples and tutorials on fitting Bayesian mixture models in Stan, demonstrating the practical implementation of these models.

In this case study I will first introduce how mixture models are implemented in Bayesian inference. I will then discuss the non-identifiability inherent to that construction as well as how the non-identifiability can be tempered with principled prior information. Lastly I will demonstrate how these issues manifest in a simple example, with a final tangent to consider an additional pathology that can arise in Bayesian mixture models.


Michael [Betancourt](https://maggielieu.com/2017/03/21/multivariate-gaussian-mixture-model-done-properly/) recently wrote a nice case study describing the problems often encountered with gaussian mixture models, specifically the estimation of parameters of a mixture model and identifiability i.e. the problem with labelling [mixtures](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/case-studies/identifying_mixture_models.html). Also there has been suggestions that GMM’s can’t be easily done in Stan. I’ve found various examples online of simple 2d gaussian mixtures, and one (wrong) example of a Multivariate GMM. I wanted to demonstrate that Stan can actually do Multivariate GMM’s and very quickly! But as Mike’s already discussed problems with identifiability are still inherent in the model.



### Advantages and Limitations 

Bayesian mixture models offer several advantages in statistical modeling. Their inherent flexibility makes them well-suited for diverse tasks such as clustering, data compression, outlier detection, and generative classification. The Bayesian framework's ability to incorporate prior knowledge enhances model accuracy, especially when informative prior information is available. Moreover, these models effectively handle unobserved heterogeneity by integrating multiple data generating processes, proving valuable when data alone may not fully identify underlying patterns. The stability provided by Bayesian estimation ensures reliable posterior distributions, reducing sensitivity to issues like singularities, over-fitting, and violated identification criteria. Bayesian mixture models also facilitate the examination of the posterior distribution of the number of classes, offering insights into the underlying class structure of the data.

However, the use of Bayesian mixture models comes with certain limitations. Applying these models demands a high level of statistical expertise to appropriately specify priors and ensure correct model formulation, presenting a challenge for practitioners lacking a strong background in Bayesian statistics. The complexity of posterior inference is compounded by label switching, a phenomenon that complicates the interpretation of results. Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, in particular, may suffer from inconsistency in estimating the number of clusters, impacting their performance in clustering applications. Additionally, model fitting challenges arise, and careful evaluation of inaccuracies in predictions and comparison with alternative models are essential to address potential shortcomings.

###  Conclusion 

In this post, we learned to fit mixture models using Stan. We saw how to evaluate model fit using the usual prior and posterior predictive checks, and to investigate parameter recovery. Such mixture models are notoriously difficult to fit, but they have a lot of potential in cognitive science applications, especially in developing computational models of different kinds of cognitive processes. The reader interested in a deeper understanding of potential chllanges in the process can refer to Betancourt discussion of identification problems in Bayesian mixture models in a [case study](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/identifying_mixture_models.html).
