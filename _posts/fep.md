The free energy principle and active inference theory, developed by Karl Friston, provide a theoretical framework for understanding perception, action, and learning in biological and artificial systems. The key concepts of these theories can be outlined as follows:

## Free Energy Principle
The free energy principle is a mathematical principle of information physics, suggesting that the brain reduces surprise or uncertainty by making predictions based on internal models. It establishes that the dynamics of physical systems minimize a quantity known as surprisal or its variational upper bound, called free energy. This principle is used in Bayesian approaches to brain function and is formally related to variational Bayesian methods. The free energy principle is a "first principles" approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy[2].

The free energy principle relates to the brain's ability to make predictions by suggesting that the brain minimizes surprise or uncertainty by making predictions based on internal models and updating them using sensory input. This principle integrates Bayesian inference with active inference, where actions are guided by predictions and sensory feedback refines them[1]. In this framework, perception is seen as the minimization of free energy with respect to sensory input, and action is the minimization of the same free energy with respect to outbound action information[1]. Therefore, the free energy principle provides a theoretical basis for understanding how the brain's internal models are used to make predictions and minimize surprise, which is essential for adaptive behavior and learning.

The relationship between the free energy principle and predictive coding is that the free energy principle provides a theoretical framework for understanding the brain's function, while predictive coding is a specific implementation of the principles entailed by the free energy principle. Predictive coding is a particular form of message passing in hierarchical Bayesian models, where predictions are sent down the hierarchy and prediction errors are sent up[1]. The free energy principle subsumes predictive coding as a special case, where optimizing model parameters through a gradient descent on the time integral of free energy reduces to associative or Hebbian plasticity and is associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain[1]. Therefore, while predictive coding is a specific computational implementation, the free energy principle provides a more general and unifying perspective on brain function, perception, and learning.



## Active Inference Theory
Active inference is based on the premise that everything minimizes variational free energy, leading to simple update rules for action, perception, policy selection, learning, and the encoding of uncertainty. It characterizes perception as the minimization of free energy with respect to sensory input and action as the minimization of the same free energy with respect to outbound action information. Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior, emphasizing the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain and behavior are used across multiple disciplines[1][3].

In summary, the free energy principle and active inference theory provide a unifying framework for understanding biological and artificial systems' behavior, perception, and learning, based on the minimization of free energy or surprisal. These theories have implications for fields such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
