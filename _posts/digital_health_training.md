In response to the growing impact of IT in healthcare, a distinct field known as health informatics has emerged since the early 1980s. Health informatics aims to harness the potential of information technology to improve the healthcare system comprehensively. Various definitions of health informatics have been proposed, all emphasizing the use of information to enhance healthcare. For instance, Hoyt et al. (2018) define health informatics as _"the field of information science concerned with the management of health-related data and information via computers and other applications."_ Similarly, the American National Library of Medicine characterizes health informatics as _"the interdisciplinary study of the design, development, adoption, and application of information technology-based innovations to service delivery, management, and planning."_ In the French context, health informatics is often referred to as _"santé numérique."_ Health informatics operates at the convergence of three primary fields: health, social and behavioral sciences, and information sciences and technologies. This multidisciplinary approach draws from a diverse range of concepts and knowledge, all focused on developing, implementing, and utilizing healthcare IT while managing associated challenges and risks.

Despite its considerable potential, the integration of healthcare IT comes with certain challenges and risks. Healthcare professionals and managers must acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to select and integrate these IT tools into their practices and organizations. This process is essential for optimizing the quality and safety of care while ensuring the cost-effective use of resources and a long-term vision for sustainability. Furthermore, managers must be proficient in selecting, configuring, installing, and supporting systems that can radically transform healthcare processes. Success in this endeavor requires the mobilization of appropriate resources in a context characterized by resource limitations and high specialization. Additionally, healthcare IT must align with the expectations and preferences of patients and citizens. The modern era has witnessed a surge in technology adoption, driven in part by technology giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft (GAFAM), who engage with patients directly. Meeting the evolving needs of tech-savvy patients is crucial in the context of healthcare IT adoption.
