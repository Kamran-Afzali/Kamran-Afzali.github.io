McKenna (2021) introduces a general approach for differentially private synthetic data generation, which involves selecting low-dimensional marginals, adding noise to measure them, and generating synthetic data that preserves these marginals. This approach is implemented in the NIST-MST and MST mechanisms, with the former winning the 2018 NIST contest. Bowen (2019, 2021) provides a comparative evaluation of differentially private synthetic data algorithms, including those from the NIST PSCR challenge, based on data accuracy and usability. Rosenblatt (2020) further evaluates differentially private generative adversarial networks for data synthesis, highlighting the need for effective assessment and proposing the QUAIL ensemble-based modeling approach.
