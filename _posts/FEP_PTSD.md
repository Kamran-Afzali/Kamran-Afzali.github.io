Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly impacts individuals who have experienced traumatic events, such as combat veterans, first responders, and abuse survivors. Traditional models often focus narrowly on specific dysfunctions in neurobiology or behavioral patterns. However, a more recent approach using the active inference framework aims to unify these perspectives by reinterpreting neuropsychological dysfunctions, by recasting concepts like executive control, attention, and contextual processing in terms of active inference. The active inference framework puts forward tye need for a generative model that explains PTSD through message passing and belief updating. The framework's explanatory approach involves four interacting levels: embodied-embedded behavioral dynamics, neurobiological substrates, hierarchical Bayesian models of interactions, and psychophysical/phenomenological observations. For instance, under active inference, reward is seen as minimizing expected free energy, with the "fight or flight" response as a survival strategy involving high metabolic expenditure. This response must balance energy allocation to ensure survival against perceived threats.

This approach views PTSD as a maladaptive stress response from an evolutionary perspective, aligning with broader theories of stress and emotion. It emphasizes self-preservation through active inference, where the organism must allocate metabolic resources to avoid existential danger. This alternative perspective on PTSD by reinterprets traditional concepts of top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory control, and attention within an embodied and environmentally embedded neuronal framework. This new perspective also redefines neurocognitive functions such as reality testing, fear generalization, fear extinction, and safety learning. PTSD may cause individuals to adopt maladaptive priors, favoring "fight or flight" or "freeze" responses over exploratory behaviors. These maladaptive priors hinder the usual reality-testing process, preventing the continuous reassessment of the world and reinforcing pathological responses. Physiologically, this impaired belief updating is seen as a form of sensory attenuation, where the precision of sensory signals is covertly reduced. This conserves metabolic energy by limiting sensory processing to higher cortical areas, leading to weakened effective connectivity due to neurochemical imbalances. The PTSD response prioritizes safety, often resulting in a state of heightened threat preparedness. This physiological state change is characterized by a reluctance to explore and confirm an "all clear" signal, perpetuating a self-maintaining threat state. This perspective aligns with known neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral patterns associated with PTSD, offering predictive and construct validity.

Repeated exposure to stressors can lead to changes in the brain's predictive models, resulting in either habituation or sensitization to stress. PTSD can be understood through two main dysfunctions: a heightened bias for interpreting sensory stimuli as existential threats and a compromised ability to reassess these threats. Individuals with PTSD are more likely to perceive neutral stimuli as threats and maintain this perception even when the threat no longer exists. This results in a prolonged threat-response state, which can explain the hyperarousal and low cortisol levels observed in PTSD patients. The neurobiological basis for these dysfunctions involves abnormal neuromodulation, where the brain's mechanisms for encoding sensory precision and processing prediction errors are impaired. Stress can weaken synaptic efficacy and network connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), leading to a reduced ability to process sensory information accurately. This results in a reliance on strong top-down biases, where the brain defaults to threat responses due to inadequate sensory evidence processing. In PTSD, stress-induced impairments prevent the brain leads to lower information transfer and a stronger attraction to the threat-response state. This state inhibits the neurochemical mechanisms necessary to escape the stress response, resulting in a persistent threat perception. Simulation studies support this model, showing that effective neuronal communication relies on synchronized activity, which is disrupted in PTSD. This disruption leads to imprecise sensory processing and an overreliance on threat priors. The amygdala, which is crucial for processing fear and threat-related stimuli, becomes overactive and inhibits the PFC, further impairing the ability to reassess and mitigate perceived threats.

Another key aspect is the concept of aberrant precision weighting, where individuals with PTSD tend to overestimate the precision of threat-related predictions. This results in persistent and exaggerated fear responses even in safe environments, explaining the characteristic hypervigilance and re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD. The strength of applying the free energy principle and active inference to PTSD lies in their ability to recontextualize and integrate a range of empirical evidence. These frameworks offer a predictive model of how sensory-perceptual and cognitive aspects of anxiety may arise, going beyond static belief/filter models often applied in traditional cognitive-behavioral approaches. Similar to anxiety, traumatic experiences can lead to a heightened state of uncertainty and unpredictability, causing the brain to overestimate the likelihood of future threats. This learned uncertainty perpetuates anxiety and stress responses, contributing to the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Stress habituation can also be understood using the free energy principle. We have also mentioned that active inference extends FEP framework by emphasizing the role of action in minimizing free energy. In PTSD, this can manifest as maladaptive explore-exploit dynamics. Individuals may exhibit impaired ability to update their beliefs about environmental safety, leading to either excessive avoidance (over-exploitation of perceived safe behaviors) or risky behaviors (maladaptive exploration) as coping mechanisms. 


The role of precision in predictive coding is central to understanding perception and action in autism. Predictive coding is a neurobiologically plausible model explaining how the brain processes sensory information by generating predictions and comparing them to actual sensory input. Precision, in this context, refers to the gain or excitability of neurons encoding prediction errors, which are discrepancies between expected and actual sensory inputs. High sensory precision, relative to prior beliefs, can lead to an overwhelming focus on sensory details and difficulty integrating broader contextual information.

Autistic perception is often characterized by an intense focus on local details and a lack of central coherence, meaning a difficulty in integrating sensory inputs into a cohesive whole. This results in behaviors such as superior performance on tasks that require focusing on individual parts of a visual stimulus but impairments on tasks that require understanding the overall context. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that individuals with autism exhibit increased activation in visual cortical areas and decreased activation in prefrontal areas during tasks that involve spatial-contextual processing. This suggests heightened bottom-up visual processing and insufficient attenuation of sensory prediction errors.

A failure to appropriately attenuate sensory precision in autism may be due to a lack of sensory attenuation, where sensory prediction errors remain overly precise and context insensitive. This phenomenon can be observed in the diminished adaptive neuronal response to repeated stimuli, known as repetition suppression or adaptation. In autism, this suppression is often less effective, indicating a failure to reduce the precision of prediction errors over repeated exposures. This is also evident in studies of mismatch negativity (MMN) in electroencephalography (EEG), where autistic individuals show atypical responses to repeated and unexpected stimuli.

The effects of heightened sensory precision in autism extend to various perceptual phenomena. For instance, in binocular rivalry, where different images are presented to each eye, autistic individuals experience longer durations of mixed percepts and slower perceptual alternations, suggesting reduced neuronal inhibition and competition among high-level explanations for sensory input. This aligns with the idea that sensory precision outweighs prior beliefs, leading to difficulty in resolving ambiguous sensory inputs.

Visual illusions, which rely on prior expectations to interpret ambiguous sensory information, also highlight differences in perceptual processing in autism. Autistic individuals tend to be less susceptible to certain visual illusions, possibly due to an overemphasis on precise sensory input at the expense of prior contextual knowledge. This reduced susceptibility to illusions can be linked to the high sensory precision observed in autistic perception.

Additionally, the concept of environmental volatility, or fluctuations in the precision of sensory inputs, plays a significant role in adaptive behavior. Computational-fMRI studies have shown that representations of environmental volatility are found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region where structural and functional abnormalities have been reported in autism. Increased activation in the ACC in response to expected but infrequent stimuli suggests a failure to adjust sensory processing based on contextual uncertainty.

In the context of action, the predictive coding framework posits that actions are aimed at minimizing sensory prediction errors. Repetitive behaviors, or "stimming," commonly observed in autism, can be understood as attempts to control sensory input by generating predictable outcomes. This is a coping strategy to manage the overwhelming sensory precision and maintain a sense of control over the environment.

Social interaction, one of the most uncertain and complex aspects of perception, poses significant challenges for individuals with autism. Neuroimaging studies have shown that autistic individuals exhibit atypical responses to social stimuli, such as eye gaze and ironic statements, reflecting a failure to use contextual information to predict and interpret social behavior. This difficulty in social prediction underscores the broader issue of imbalanced sensory precision and prior beliefs in autism.

In summary, the aberrant encoding of precision in predictive coding can explain many features of autistic sensation, perception, and action. The heightened sensory precision relative to prior beliefs leads to difficulties in contextualizing sensory information, resulting in behaviors like sensory overload, repetitive actions, and social-communication challenges. This perspective integrates functional and neurobiological insights, offering a comprehensive understanding of autism's core characteristics and providing a basis for future research and interventions.
