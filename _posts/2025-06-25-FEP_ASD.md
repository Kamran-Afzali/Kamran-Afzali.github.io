### Autism Spectrum Disorder and Free Energy Principle  

The free energy principle (FEP) and active inference framework attempts to provide a novel computational model to understand autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that conceptualize ASD as a disorder of inference, where the brain's ability to predict and respond to sensorial and social stimuli is altered due to atypical precision weighting and predictive coding mechanisms. Traditional autism research often suggests that autistic individuals have an impaired theory of mind, which refers to the ability to infer others' mental states. This theory of mind is divided into Theory Theory and Simulation Theory. However, phenomenological perspectives, such as enactivism, critique these views as overly cognitive and not accounting for the embodied and ecological nature of cognition. Enactivism holds that social understanding arises from direct sensorimotor interactions rather than abstract cognitive processes. It views the brain, body, and environment as a unified system in which the brain acts as a mediating organ. Predictive Processing framework is based on Bayesian probability, puts that the brain continuously generates predictions that are compared with actual sensory data, with discrepancies termed prediction errors. In autistic individuals, the integration of these predictions and sensory signals is atypical, leading to experiences of sensory overload in environments like supermarkets. In other words, autistic experiences such as meltdowns or shutdowns the autopoietic system is overwhelmed by prediction errors. 


#### Aberrant Precision Weighting


The concept of precision weighting refers to the reliability or confidence assigned to different sources of information, whether sensory inputs or prior beliefs. From a Bayesian perspective, the brain constantly generates hypotheses about the causes of sensory evidence, which can be seen as prior expectations formed over various timescales and hierarchical levels, from basic visual patterns to complex facial expressions. Predictive coding theories suggest that higher brain areas generate top-down predictions that meet bottom-up signals in lower sensory areas. The mismatch between sensory input and predictions, called prediction error, informs higher-level expectations to generate better predictions and reduce future errors. The influence of prior beliefs versus sensory evidence is modulated by precision, or the confidence in prediction errors at each hierarchical level. High sensory precision amplifies the influence of ascending prediction errors, while low sensory precision biases perception towards prior beliefs.

The challenge of optimal perception involves inferring the causes of sensory inputs. This task is complicated by the inherent ambiguity in sensory inputs, where different causes can generate identical sensations, leading to the *"inverse problem of perception"*. Resolving this problem requires prior beliefs about the generation of sensations. Additionally, it is necessary to estimate the confidence placed in sensory evidence relative to these prior beliefs. Inaccurate confidence estimation compromises perceptual inference, similar to statistical inference without a proper estimate of standard error.

It has been proposed that in autism, high-level prior precision may be attenuated relative to sensory precision, leading to an overemphasis on sensory input and impaired contextualization of sensory information. This suggests that individuals with autism may give disproportionate weight to sensory evidence, driving their beliefs excessively. In autism, there may be an imbalance in how precision is allocated, with sensory inputs potentially being given too much weight relative to prior beliefs. This can result in a reduced ability to filter out irrelevant sensory information, leading to sensory overload and difficulties in extracting meaningful patterns from the environment. One key application of this framework to autism is in explaining sensory atypicalities. According to Lawson et al. (2017), adults with autism tend to overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment. This can be understood through the lens of active inference as an aberrant precision weighting of sensory inputs. In autism, there may be an overestimation of the unreliability or changeability of sensory information, leading to a constant state of surprise and difficulty in forming stable predictions about the environment.

Another important aspect is the idea of context-sensitive modulation of prediction errors. Research suggests that individuals with autism may have difficulties in flexibly adjusting their predictions based on context. This could explain why autistic individuals often struggle with changes in routine or unexpected events, as their predictive models may be less adaptable to changing circumstances. This also can result in difficulties in filtering out irrelevant sensory information, leading to sensory overload and challenges in social interactions. For instance, Pellicano and Burr (2012) suggest that individuals with autism might overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment, which could lead to a constant state of surprise and difficulty in forming stable predictions about social cues and interactions.

Coping strategies, including withdrawal from sensory stimulation, can be seen as efforts to avoid excessive prediction errors. This withdrawal resembles the “dark room problem” in predictive coding, where minimizing sensory input can reduce prediction errors. However, this metaphor—though analytically useful—can oversimplify the rich phenomenology of autistic experience. Withdrawal might also result from the failure to develop internal models necessary for interacting with the world, particularly in social contexts. These behaviors align with neurodevelopmental theories of autism, suggesting that atypical behaviors arise from attempts to balance sensory evidence and top-down beliefs. Along these lines, autistic withdrawal from overstimulating environments might not only be seen as error minimization, but also as a **protective act of boundary-setting**, or even as an expression of agency in a world that demands conformity. The metaphor of the “dark room” implies a retreat from experience, but the deeper question is: *what kind of experience is on offer?* For those constantly bombarded with overwhelming stimuli and misunderstood intentions, retreat might be not pathological but **rational**.



#### Social Cognition and Predictive Coding

Social interaction presents the greatest uncertainty for individuals with autism, due to the unpredictability and complexity of other agents' behavior. This unpredictability exacerbates difficulties in social communication, as it demands finely tuned and contextually precise prior beliefs to interpret ambiguous or noisy sensory input. Although neuroimaging studies on social interaction in autism are relatively sparse, existing research provides compelling support for predictive processing anomalies. One study revealed that neurotypical adults exhibit a **prediction error-like neural response** in the **superior temporal sulcus (STS)** when eye gaze behavior violates expectations—an effect thought to reflect social prediction mechanisms. Autistic individuals, however, do not exhibit this predictive effect, indicating a potential failure to anticipate gaze behavior, or more generally, a failure to encode and update hierarchical social expectations.

Another neuroimaging study found that autistic children, when interpreting **ironic statements**, displayed increased neural activation in regions associated with **effortful cognitive control** and **language comprehension**, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left inferior frontal gyrus. This increased activity may reflect the additional effort required to reconcile literal and contextual meanings, highlighting challenges in **contextualizing sensory processing** during social interactions. These findings support the notion that prediction-based social inference in autism involves **increased cognitive load**, likely due to lower precision priors or noisier likelihood estimations in social domains.

Cecilia Heyes’ concept of *cognitive gadgets*—learned rather than innate cognitive processes—offers a complementary, developmental explanation. Heyes argues that key aspects of social cognition, including **mindreading**, are **culturally acquired** through imitation, pedagogy, and social interaction rather than genetically preprogrammed. She supports this view with behavioral genetic studies showing that the **heritability of Theory of Mind** abilities is minimal, particularly after early childhood. This suggests that the development of social cognition is highly sensitive to **experiential and environmental factors**.

Supporting this claim, evidence from studies on **blindness** and **childhood maltreatment** shows that children deprived of normative social sensory input exhibit **higher rates of autism-like symptoms**. For instance, blind children often struggle with gaze-following and perspective-taking, while children exposed to trauma or neglect may display difficulties in emotional attunement and social reciprocity. These findings highlight the **developmental plasticity** of social cognition and underscore the importance of **sensorimotor engagement** and **affective synchrony** in shaping typical cognitive trajectories. They also provide support for the view that autism may be **fundamentally linked to atypical sensorimotor contingencies**, consistent with the enactivist emphasis on **embodied cognition**.

Enactivism, therefore, not only offers a valuable theoretical lens for understanding the autistic experience but also stands to **benefit from integrating autism research** into its own theoretical refinement. Autism exemplifies how disruptions in early sensorimotor coupling can affect not only motor control and sensory integration but also higher-order functions such as language, emotion regulation, and intersubjectivity. Thus, studying autism from an enactivist perspective helps clarify the **constitutive role of embodiment** in cognitive development, reinforcing the notion that cognition is not confined to internal representations but emerges from the **dynamical interplay** between brain, body, and world.

#### Conclusion 

The free energy principle and active inference framework provide a novel perspective for understanding autism spectrum disorder. These approaches emphasize unique ways autistic individuals process sensory and social information, focusing on precision weighting and predictive coding rather than viewing autism as a deficit. By integrating sensory challenges, social cognition, and adaptive behaviors, this model captures the complexity of autistic experiences. However, the computational framing invites several important caveats. While the active inference model provides a unifying mathematical formalism for perception and action, it must be interpreted with care. The concept of "precision" is an inferred computational variable, not a directly measurable physiological signal. This introduces an epistemological circularity: heightened reactivity to sensory input might be taken as evidence of high sensory precision, but that inference presupposes the very model it is supposed to support. Moreover, empirical evidence for precision weighting anomalies in autism remains limited and sometimes contradictory, with considerable individual variability across and within autistic populations. For instance, some individuals exhibit sensory hyposensitivity or shifting sensitivities depending on context, challenging the notion of a single, static precision profile. Further, the emphasis on imbalance implicitly frames autism in deficit terms—where the "ideal" cognitive system is one with optimally calibrated priors and sensory weights. Yet from the perspective of the **neurodiversity paradigm**, autistic cognition may reflect alternative, not defective, forms of world-modeling. What appears as an overemphasis on sensory data may, in some environments, be an asset for detecting subtle regularities or resisting normative biases. Predictive coding, for all its explanatory power, risks reducing psychological phenomena to computational errors, unless embedded within a broader understanding of developmental, social, and existential contexts. Future research should explore practical applications of these insights, such as developing interventions that support sensory modulation and improve social adaptability, respecting the diversity of autistic individuals' experiences.
