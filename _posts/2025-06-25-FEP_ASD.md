### Autism Spectrum Disorder and Free Energy Principle  

The free energy principle (FEP) and active inference framework attempts to provide a novel computational model to understand autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that conceptualize ASD as a disorder of inference, where the brain's ability to predict and respond to sensorial and social stimuli is altered due to atypical precision weighting and predictive coding mechanisms. Traditional autism research often suggests that autistic individuals have an impaired theory of mind, which refers to the ability to infer others' mental states. This theory of mind is divided into Theory Theory and Simulation Theory. However, phenomenological perspectives, such as enactivism, critique these views as overly cognitive and not accounting for the embodied and ecological nature of cognition. Enactivism holds that social understanding arises from direct sensorimotor interactions rather than abstract cognitive processes. It views the brain, body, and environment as a unified system in which the brain acts as a mediating organ. Predictive Processing framework is based on Bayesian probability, puts that the brain continuously generates predictions that are compared with actual sensory data, with discrepancies termed prediction errors. In autistic individuals, the integration of these predictions and sensory signals is atypical, leading to experiences of sensory overload in environments like supermarkets. In other words, autistic experiences such as meltdowns or shutdowns the autopoietic system is overwhelmed by prediction errors. 


#### Aberrant Precision Weighting

The concept of precision weighting refers to the reliability or confidence assigned to different sources of information, whether sensory inputs or prior beliefs. From a Bayesian perspective, the brain constantly generates hypotheses about the causes of sensory evidence, which can be seen as prior expectations formed over various timescales and hierarchical levels, from basic visual patterns to complex facial expressions. Predictive coding theories suggest that higher brain areas generate top-down predictions that meet bottom-up signals in lower sensory areas. The mismatch between sensory input and predictions, called prediction error, informs higher-level expectations to generate better predictions and reduce future errors. The influence of prior beliefs versus sensory evidence is modulated by precision, or the confidence in prediction errors at each hierarchical level. High sensory precision amplifies the influence of ascending prediction errors, while low sensory precision biases perception towards prior beliefs. The challenge of optimal perception involves inferring the causes of sensory inputs. This task is complicated by the inherent ambiguity in sensory inputs, where different causes can generate identical sensations, leading to the _"inverse problem of perception"_. Resolving this problem requires prior beliefs about the generation of sensations. Additionally, it is necessary to estimate the confidence placed in sensory evidence relative to these prior beliefs. Inaccurate confidence estimation compromises perceptual inference, similar to statistical inference without a proper estimate of standard error. It has been proposed that in autism, high-level prior precision may be attenuated relative to sensory precision, leading to an overemphasis on sensory input and impaired contextualization of sensory information. This suggests that individuals with autism may give disproportionate weight to sensory evidence, driving their beliefs excessively.

In autism, there may be an imbalance in how precision is allocated, with sensory inputs potentially being given too much weight relative to prior beliefs. This can result in a reduced ability to filter out irrelevant sensory information, leading to sensory overload and difficulties in extracting meaningful patterns from the environment. One key application of this framework to autism is in explaining sensory atypicalities. According to Lawson et al. (2017), adults with autism tend to overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment. This can be understood through the lens of active inference as an aberrant precision weighting of sensory inputs. In autism, there may be an overestimation of the unreliability or changeability of sensory information, leading to a constant state of surprise and difficulty in forming stable predictions about the environment. Another important aspect is the idea of context-sensitive modulation of prediction errors. Research suggests that individuals with autism may have difficulties in flexibly adjusting their predictions based on context. This could explain why autistic individuals often struggle with changes in routine or unexpected events, as their predictive models may be less adaptable to changing circumstances. This also can result in difficulties in filtering out irrelevant sensory information, leading to sensory overload and challenges in social interactions. For instance, Pellicano and Burr (2012) suggest that individuals with autism might overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment, which could lead to a constant state of surprise and difficulty in forming stable predictions about social cues and interactions. Coping strategies, including withdrawal from sensory stimulation, can be seen as efforts to avoid excessive prediction errors. This withdrawal resembles the “dark room problem” in predictive coding, where minimizing sensory input can reduce prediction errors. Alternatively, withdrawal might result from the failure to develop internal models necessary for interacting with the world, particularly in social contexts. These behaviors align with neurodevelopmental theories of autism, suggesting that atypical behaviors arise from attempts to balance sensory evidence and top-down beliefs.


#### Social Cognition and Predictive Coding

According to FEP the brain operates as a Bayesian inference machine, constantly updating its internal models to minimize prediction errors. In the context of social cognition, this means accurately predicting others' behaviors and intentions based on social cues. However, individuals with autism may have difficulties in this predictive coding process. They might struggle with the flexible adjustment of predictions based on social context, leading to challenges in interpreting and responding to social cues. This can manifest as difficulties in understanding and predicting others' mental states, a core aspect of social interactions. The process of inferring others' mental states and intentions can be viewed as a form of active inference and difficulties in this area could be related to atypical precision weighting of social cues or challenges in flexibly updating social predictions. The enactive-dynamic approach to social cognition, which is compatible with active inference, emphasizes the real-time, fluid, and contextual nature of social interactions. This perspective suggests that social cognition is not just about internal representations but involves continuous interaction with the environment. For individuals with autism, this dynamic interaction may be disrupted due to atypical sensorimotor processing and difficulties in synchronizing with social partners. The enactive-dynamic model highlights how these disruptions can lead to challenges in social understanding and engagement.

It's important to note that while the free energy principle and active inference offer a promising framework for understanding autism, they do not suggest that autism is a deficit or disorder in the traditional sense. Instead, they provide a way to understand the different information processing strategies that may be employed by autistic individuals. By focusing on processes such as precision weighting, prediction error modulation, and adaptive inference, these frameworks offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the diverse manifestations of autism spectrum disorder. This approach not only aligns with existing empirical evidence but also provides a unifying theoretical framework that can guide future research and potentially inform intervention strategies for individuals with autism.

Social interaction presents the greatest uncertainty for individuals with autism, due to the unpredictability of other agents. This unpredictability exacerbates difficulties in social-communication, as it demands precise prior beliefs to contextualize sensory input. Neuroimaging studies on social interaction in autism are sparse, but one study revealed that neurotypical adults show a prediction error-like response in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) when eye gaze behavior violates expectations. Autistic individuals, however, do not exhibit this predictive effect, indicating a failure to anticipate gaze behavior. Another study found that autistic children, when interpreting ironic statements, displayed increased neural activation in regions associated with effortful processing. This increased activity could reflect a struggle to reconcile spoken content with contextual cues, highlighting challenges in contextualizing sensory processing in social interactions. Cecilia Heyes' concept of _Cognitive Gadgets_, learned rather than innate cognitive processes, is used to argue that social cognition, including mindreading, is culturally acquired. She supports this with research showing that genetic influence on theory of mind is minimal. Evidence from studies on blindness and childhood maltreatment further suggests that social cognition is heavily dependent on sensory input and environmental factors. Blind children and those who experience maltreatment show higher rates of autism-like symptoms, indicating the importance of sensory and social learning environments in developing social cognition. Thereby, autism might be fundamentally linked to an atypical sensorimotor system, aligning with enactivist views that emphasize the role of sensorimotor processes in cognitive development. Enactivism, therefore, not only offers insights into the autistic experience but also benefits from understanding autism, reinforcing the significance of the sensorimotor system in the broader cognitive landscape.


#### Conclusion 

The free energy principle and active inference framework provide a novel perspective for understanding autism spectrum disorder. These approaches emphasize unique ways autistic individuals process sensory and social information, focusing on precision weighting and predictive coding rather than viewing autism as a deficit. By integrating sensory challenges, social cognition, and adaptive behaviors, this model captures the complexity of autistic experiences. Future research should explore practical applications of these insights, such as developing interventions that support sensory modulation and improve social adaptability, respecting the diversity of autistic individuals' experiences.
