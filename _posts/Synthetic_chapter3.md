The utilization of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, encompassing clinical symptoms, diagnoses, investigations, and treatments, has gained prominence in data mining and machine learning applications. Notable instances include studies by Khalid et al., offering insights into drug use patterns, and Ravizza et al., proposing diagnostic and predictive disease applications. However, a need arises for synthetic datasets to complement real-world data due to challenges such as stringent access regulations, cost inefficiency, and privacy concerns associated with actual patient records.

Accessing individual real-world records, even in pseudonymized form, is subject to strict regulations to prevent inadvertent patient reidentification. Synthetic datasets, devoid of personal identifiers, could streamline data access approvals and accelerate research innovation. The cost-effectiveness of using synthetic data for benchmarking and validation is emphasized, offering a more economical alternative to expanding the coverage of real-world data. Additionally, the efficiency of testing algorithms or functions is highlighted, particularly for scenarios like assessing scalability and robustness.

Patient privacy protection, completeness in data research, and benchmarking capabilities are underscored as advantages of synthetic data. Despite these benefits, there is a lack of a comprehensive synthetic data generation approach for healthcare data that ensures preservation of key characteristics while safeguarding patient privacy. The proposed framework in this article aims to address this gap by focusing on clinically meaningful synthetic data generation while adhering to key requirements such as preserving biological relationships, univariate and multivariate distances, and privacy preservation.
