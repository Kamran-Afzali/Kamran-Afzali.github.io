The free energy principle (FEP) and active inference framework to understanding substance use disorder (SUD) conceptualize addiction as a disorder of inference and decision-making, where maladaptive behaviors arise from the brain's attempts to minimize free energy through suboptimal models and predictions. Addiction significantly disrupts the lives of those affected and despite recognizing the negative consequences, addicts often continue their behavior even when it no longer provides pleasure, feeling compelled by a force beyond their control. This post argues that addiction should be seen as a self-organizing process within an agent-environment system. It becomes harmful when feedback loops lock individuals into destructive behaviors. Addiction is thus rooted in the dynamic interaction between a person and their environment.

The effects of addictive substances on the brain's dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain have been widely studied, leading to the adoption of the "disease model" of addiction. This model suggests that prolonged substance use induces changes in the nervous system, making it difficult for addicts to change their behavior due to dysfunctional reward learning systems. These systems influence various aspects of cognition, emotion, and decision-making, explaining the compulsive nature of drug-seeking behavior and the difficulty in overcoming addiction.

However, according to the predictive processing within the active inference framework theory ,reward is not the cause of action but its consequence. Agents predict rewarding outcomes and choose actions that fulfill these predictions, thus minimizing long-term prediction error. Dopamine is thought to signal the confidence in relevant affordances, which are the opportunities for action available in the environment. Addiction disrupts this process by creating false feedback through substance use, leading addicts to believe they are minimizing error when they are actually increasing it. The predictive processing theory suggests that addiction is not solely a disorder of the brain but a result of disordered interactions within the agent-environment system. The brain, while crucial, is only part of the story, and addiction's harm is how it skews the person's ability to attune to relevant affordances in their environment, leading to the neglect of other life aspects. The Predictive Processing theory suggests that addictive behaviors are not passive reactions to sensory cues but are actively driven by the agent's aim to achieve expected future sensory states. 

In this context, dopamine signals the precision of affordances, indicating the likelihood of achieving predicted sensory states. In addiction, dopamine's role shifts to confirming high precision for drug-related actions, creating a feedback loop where drug use continually signals successful error reduction, even if illusory. This mechanism drives the addict to seek drugs proactively, reinforcing their behavior through predicted sensory cues associated with drug procurement. The illusion of rapid error reduction through drug use creates a misleading sense of well-being, exacerbating addiction. This repeated behavior trains the agent to expect fast error reduction from drug use, leading to a cycle of seeking the substance to meet these expectations. Cravings are thus seen as the body's response to unmet error reduction rates, compelling the addict to use the drug again. Moreover, addiction causes agents to focus narrowly on drug-related actions, neglecting other important aspects of their lives. This behavior is explained through the concept of a dynamical landscape of attractors, where addicts are locked into fixed-point attractors due to the consistent and predictable outcomes of drug use, even if detrimental. This rigid behavior contrasts with the typical adaptive exploration of uncertain environments for better long-term outcomes.

Agents develop and maintain their identity through biological autonomy, which involves fulfilling predictions about their environment. This identity is sustained by a generative model, an internal hierarchy of predictions that the agent uses to interact with its environment. This model helps the agent bring about predicted sensory inputs, a process termed active inference. In this context, an agent's way of life, including its habits, contributes to maintaining its identity by minimizing unexpected sensory states and avoiding prediction errors.  In addiction, habits and rituals become central to the addict's life, organizing their social and personal world around substance use. The predictability and reliability of substance effects can provide stability in otherwise challenging circumstances. This integration into the addict's identity is profound, making it difficult for them to change without fundamentally altering their sense of self. Substance use often begins within a community context, conferring a sense of belonging, which complicates efforts to quit once addiction sets in.

The Bayesian inference framework emphasizes the role of an agent's generative model of the world in determining optimal inference. Witin this context the suboptimal or pathological behavior should not be seen as a failure of Bayesian inference itself but rather as a consequence of the agent’s prior beliefs embedded in their generative model. Essentially, even if behavior deviates from what is considered optimal, it can still be understood through the lens of Bayesian inference if the agent’s generative model is considered. While some evidence suggests that the brain performs close to optimal Bayesian inference in some instances, deviations from this optimality often occur due to differences in the generative models employed by different individuals. These deviations can be seen in characteristic suboptimal behaviors, such as those observed in certain psychiatric conditions.

Suboptimal behavior can arise from two potential causes: failures in the inference process itself or failures in the generative models upon which inference is based. They argue that in many cases, pathological behavior results from maladaptive generative models rather than broken inference mechanisms. By focusing on the specifics of these generative models, rather than on deviations from a presumed optimal behavior, one can better understand and address psychiatric conditions. For instance, the generative model of an addict might lead them to behave in ways that appear suboptimal when viewed from an external perspective. However, from the perspective of the addict’s generative model, their behavior may be optimal. This insight can have significant implications for diagnosing and treating psychiatric conditions by identifying specific parameters or aspects of the generative model that lead to maladaptive behaviors. Along these lines and from a computational standpoint, addiction may result from a shift from action-outcome control to stimulus-response control, favoring habitual behaviors. This shift is often seen as a transition from impulsion to compulsion, where initial pleasure-seeking behavior evolves into automatic and habitual actions. Another view suggests a transition from liking to wanting, where addicts compulsively seek drugs or drug-like behavior without deriving pleasure from it.

Novel models of addiction, such as those proposed by Friston and Schwartenbeck et al., explain aberrant decision-making in addiction through alterations in uncertainty about future rewards. Friston's model of addiction simulates impairments in reversal learning based on high levels of dopamine, which increases the precision of prediction error signals in the neural hierarchy. This heightened precision results in strong expectations of reward continuity, causing the agent to persist in seeking a reward at a previous location even when it is no longer available. Thus, addiction is viewed as a pathology of hyper-precision. In addiction, midbrain dopamine neurons are proposed to encode the precision of probability distributions over possible actions rather than just reward prediction error. Precision, synonymous with neural gain, is modulated by dopamine and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in neuron populations. This increased precision sharpens the probability distribution over possible actions, enhancing the influence of hyper-precise model-free reward estimates, particularly in the striatum. Optogenetic studies have shown that increased dopamine transmission in the striatum enhances the firing rate of neurons expressing D1 dopamine receptors, directly linking dopamine to increased neural excitability and precision.

This is in contrast with a view of addiction as hypo-precise model-based prediction suggests that there is a reduced model-based control in various addictions, such as alcohol dependence, binge drinking, cocaine addiction, and gambling disorder. These reductions in model-based control correlate with increased compulsivity and decreased activation in neural structures associated with model-based control, like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In other words, addiction is linked to greater environmental uncertainty, leading to less precise model-based reward predictions. For instance, reduced prefrontal grey matter density, associated with heavy use of addictive substances, is linked to impairments in model-based learning and action-outcome prediction. These structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, observed in heroin, nicotine, cocaine, and heavy alcohol users, may underlie cognitive impairments seen in addiction, similar to those in patients with frontal lesions. Environmental unpredictability, such as lack of social support or poverty, can also contribute to imprecise reward predictions. Accurate representations of true environmental uncertainty produce the same effect as uncertain representations, leading to imprecise estimates of reward and increased model-free control. For example, increasing the true underlying uncertainty in decision-making tasks evokes model-free control. In real life, factors like social support and poverty significantly impact addiction and relapse rates.  Along these lines, stress has been shown to reduce model-based decision-making, particularly in individuals with lower working memory capacity, encouraging a reversion to habitual behaviors and increasing relapse likelihood. Imprecise model-based reward predictions, regardless of their cause, shift behavior away from goal-directed control, resulting in heightened impulsivity. When an individual addicted to alcohol encounters an alcohol-related cue, factors like chronic alcohol consumption impair the working memory-intensive process of reasoning through action-outcome associations. Stress from adverse life events further diminishes working memory capacity, increasing the true unpredictability of the future and limiting the certainty of model-based predictions. This underweighting of model-based predictions leads to steep discounting of future outcomes and maintains addiction.


**Conclusion**
The free energy principle and active inference framework offer a comprehensive computational model for understanding substance use disorder. By focusing on maladaptive decision-making processes, aberrant precision weighting, and the transition from goal-directed to habitual behaviors, these frameworks provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying addiction. This approach not only aligns with existing empirical evidence but also offers a unifying theoretical framework that can guide future research and inform intervention strategies to address the complex nature of addiction.
