#### SUD

The free energy principle (FEP) and active inference framework to understanding substance use disorder (SUD) conceptualize addiction as a disorder of inference and decision-making, where maladaptive behaviors arise from the brain's attempts to minimize free energy through suboptimal models and predictions. Addiction significantly disrupts the lives of those affected and despite recognizing the negative consequences, addicts often continue their behavior even when it no longer provides pleasure, feeling compelled by a force beyond their control. This post argues that addiction should be seen as a self-organizing process within an agent-environment system. It becomes harmful when feedback loops lock individuals into destructive behaviors. Addiction is thus rooted in the dynamic interaction between a person and their environment.

The effects of addictive substances on the brain's dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain have been widely studied, leading to the adoption of the "disease model" of addiction. This model suggests that prolonged substance use induces changes in the nervous system, making it difficult for addicts to change their behavior due to dysfunctional reward learning systems. These systems influence various aspects of cognition, emotion, and decision-making, explaining the compulsive nature of drug-seeking behavior and the difficulty in overcoming addiction.

However, according to the predictive processing within the active inference framework theory ,reward is not the cause of action but its consequence. Agents predict rewarding outcomes and choose actions that fulfill these predictions, thus minimizing long-term prediction error. Dopamine is thought to signal the confidence in relevant affordances, which are the opportunities for action available in the environment. Addiction disrupts this process by creating false feedback through substance use, leading addicts to believe they are minimizing error when they are actually increasing it. The predictive processing theory suggests that addiction is not solely a disorder of the brain but a result of disordered interactions within the agent-environment system. The brain, while crucial, is only part of the story, and addiction's harm is how it skews the person's ability to attune to relevant affordances in their environment, leading to the neglect of other life aspects. The Predictive Processing theory suggests that addictive behaviors are not passive reactions to sensory cues but are actively driven by the agent's aim to achieve expected future sensory states. 

In this context, dopamine signals the precision of affordances, indicating the likelihood of achieving predicted sensory states. In addiction, dopamine's role shifts to confirming high precision for drug-related actions, creating a feedback loop where drug use continually signals successful error reduction, even if illusory. This mechanism drives the addict to seek drugs proactively, reinforcing their behavior through predicted sensory cues associated with drug procurement. The illusion of rapid error reduction through drug use creates a misleading sense of well-being, exacerbating addiction. This repeated behavior trains the agent to expect fast error reduction from drug use, leading to a cycle of seeking the substance to meet these expectations. Cravings are thus seen as the body's response to unmet error reduction rates, compelling the addict to use the drug again. Moreover, addiction causes agents to focus narrowly on drug-related actions, neglecting other important aspects of their lives. This behavior is explained through the concept of a dynamical landscape of attractors, where addicts are locked into fixed-point attractors due to the consistent and predictable outcomes of drug use, even if detrimental. This rigid behavior contrasts with the typical adaptive exploration of uncertain environments for better long-term outcomes.

Agents develop and maintain their identity through biological autonomy, which involves fulfilling predictions about their environment. This identity is sustained by a generative model, an internal hierarchy of predictions that the agent uses to interact with its environment. This model helps the agent bring about predicted sensory inputs, a process termed active inference. In this context, an agent's way of life, including its habits, contributes to maintaining its identity by minimizing unexpected sensory states and avoiding prediction errors.  In addiction, habits and rituals become central to the addict's life, organizing their social and personal world around substance use. The predictability and reliability of substance effects can provide stability in otherwise challenging circumstances. This integration into the addict's identity is profound, making it difficult for them to change without fundamentally altering their sense of self. Substance use often begins within a community context, conferring a sense of belonging, which complicates efforts to quit once addiction sets in.

The Bayesian inference framework emphasizes the role of an agent's generative model of the world in determining optimal inference. Witin this context the suboptimal or pathological behavior should not be seen as a failure of Bayesian inference itself but rather as a consequence of the agent’s prior beliefs embedded in their generative model. Essentially, even if behavior deviates from what is considered optimal, it can still be understood through the lens of Bayesian inference if the agent’s generative model is considered. While some evidence suggests that the brain performs close to optimal Bayesian inference in some instances, deviations from this optimality often occur due to differences in the generative models employed by different individuals. These deviations can be seen in characteristic suboptimal behaviors, such as those observed in certain psychiatric conditions.

Suboptimal behavior can arise from two potential causes: failures in the inference process itself or failures in the generative models upon which inference is based. They argue that in many cases, pathological behavior results from maladaptive generative models rather than broken inference mechanisms. By focusing on the specifics of these generative models, rather than on deviations from a presumed optimal behavior, one can better understand and address psychiatric conditions. For instance, the generative model of an addict might lead them to behave in ways that appear suboptimal when viewed from an external perspective. However, from the perspective of the addict’s generative model, their behavior may be optimal. This insight can have significant implications for diagnosing and treating psychiatric conditions by identifying specific parameters or aspects of the generative model that lead to maladaptive behaviors. Along these lines and from a computational standpoint, addiction may result from a shift from action-outcome control to stimulus-response control, favoring habitual behaviors. This shift is often seen as a transition from impulsion to compulsion, where initial pleasure-seeking behavior evolves into automatic and habitual actions. Another view suggests a transition from liking to wanting, where addicts compulsively seek drugs or drug-like behavior without deriving pleasure from it.







From the active inference viewpoint and focusing on subject-specific generative models, it is possible to explain differences in choice behavior between addicts and non-addicts. Precision in this context reflects the confidence in achieving a desired goal. Higher prior precision indicates greater confidence in the outcome, leading to more deliberate and goal-directed behavior. Lower precision, conversely, results in more impulsive behavior, with individuals accepting immediate offers due to a lack of confidence in achieving long-term goals. In addiction, lower prior precision can lead to inconsistent and less goal-directed behavior, manifesting as poor self-control and habitual actions. This explains why addicts might accept earlier offers, sacrificing long-term gains. Precision is linked to the dopaminergic system, and dysfunctions in this system are common in addiction, supporting the association between lower precision and impulsive behavior.

Risk-taking is another key aspect of addictive decision-making, often involving a steep discounting of future rewards. In the limited offer task, excessive risk-taking means waiting too long for a high offer, risking the loss of initial offers. This behavior can be attributed to an inaccurate representation of the hazard rate, leading to overconfidence in receiving high offers despite the risks. Conversely, an overly cautious estimate of the hazard rate could lead to premature acceptance of offers, though this is less consistent with typical addictive behavior.

Overall, addicts likely exhibit both lower prior precision and an unrealistic hazard rate, contributing to impulsive and risky behaviors. By studying these parameters in different groups, researchers can better understand the computational mechanisms underlying addiction, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment. This approach highlights how differences in generative models can explain behavioral and neuronal differences observed in addiction.

______________________________________

Recent models of addiction, such as those proposed by Friston and Schwartenbeck et al., explain aberrant decision-making in addiction through alterations in uncertainty about future rewards. Friston's model of addiction simulates impairments in reversal learning based on high levels of dopamine, which increases the precision of prediction error signals in the neural hierarchy. This heightened precision results in strong expectations of reward continuity, causing the agent to persist in seeking a reward at a previous location even when it is no longer available. Thus, addiction is viewed as a pathology of hyper-precision. In addiction, midbrain dopamine neurons are proposed to encode the precision of probability distributions over possible actions rather than just reward prediction error. Precision, synonymous with neural gain, is modulated by dopamine and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in neuron populations. This increased precision sharpens the probability distribution over possible actions, enhancing the influence of hyper-precise model-free reward estimates, particularly in the striatum. Optogenetic studies have shown that increased dopamine transmission in the striatum enhances the firing rate of neurons expressing D1 dopamine receptors, directly linking dopamine to increased neural excitability and precision.

Behaviorally, addiction is characterized by hyper-precise model-free reward predictions, leading to devaluation insensitivity and compulsive drug-seeking. During the development of drug-seeking behavior, dopamine transmission shifts from the dorsomedial to the dorsolateral striatum. This shift increases the precision of model-free reward estimates in the dorsolateral striatum, which then dominate behavior over model-based reward estimates. In addictive decision-making, cues that increase dopamine transmission in the dorsolateral striatum heighten neural excitability and precision, leading to a preference for habitual actions over deliberative, model-based decisions. This results in compulsive behaviors where the high certainty of habitual responses outweighs the less certain deliberative choices, characterizing addiction as a pathology of hyper-precise model-free prediction.

Addiction as hypo-precise model-based prediction suggests that the balance between model-free and model-based control in decision-making is influenced by the precision of reward predictions from each system. Specific studies have demonstrated reductions in model-based control in various addictions, such as alcohol dependence, binge drinking, cocaine addiction, and gambling disorder. These reductions in model-based control correlate with increased compulsivity and decreased activation in neural structures associated with model-based control, like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In other words, addiction is linked to greater environmental uncertainty, leading to less precise model-based reward predictions. For instance, reduced prefrontal grey matter density, associated with heavy use of addictive substances, is linked to impairments in model-based learning and action-outcome prediction. These structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, observed in heroin, nicotine, cocaine, and heavy alcohol users, may underlie cognitive impairments seen in addiction, similar to those in patients with frontal lesions.


Environmental unpredictability, such as lack of social support or poverty, can also contribute to imprecise reward predictions. Accurate representations of true environmental uncertainty produce the same effect as uncertain representations, leading to imprecise estimates of reward and increased model-free control. For example, increasing the true underlying uncertainty in decision-making tasks evokes model-free control. In real life, factors like social support and poverty significantly impact addiction and relapse rates.  Along the same lines, stress has been shown to reduce model-based decision-making, particularly in individuals with lower working memory capacity, encouraging a reversion to habitual behaviors and increasing relapse likelihood.

Imprecise model-based reward predictions, regardless of their cause, shift behavior away from goal-directed control, resulting in heightened impulsivity. When an individual addicted to alcohol encounters an alcohol-related cue, factors like chronic alcohol consumption impair the working memory-intensive process of reasoning through action-outcome associations. Stress from adverse life events further diminishes working memory capacity, increasing the true unpredictability of the future and limiting the certainty of model-based predictions. This underweighting of model-based predictions leads to steep discounting of future outcomes and maintains addiction.

**Maladaptive Decision-Making**
One of the central insights from applying the FEP to addiction is the understanding of maladaptive decision-making processes. According to Schwartenbeck et al. (2015), addiction can be seen as a shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior. Initially, substance use may be driven by seeking hedonic pleasure (goal-directed behavior), but over time, it transitions to automatic, habitual behavior. This shift can be explained by a change in the brain's inference mechanisms, where the control of behavior moves from action-outcome associations to stimulus-response patterns. This transition is marked by a loss of flexibility and an increase in compulsive drug-seeking behavior, even in the face of negative consequences.
1. Maladaptive decision-making: Active inference models suggest that addiction involves a shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior. Initially, substance use may be driven by seeking pleasure, but over time it transitions to automatic, habitual behavior. This is explained as a change in the brain's inference mechanisms, where behavior control moves from action-outcome associations to stimulus-response patterns, resulting in a loss of flexibility and increase in compulsive drug-seeking behavior.


**Precision Weighting and Reward Processing**
The FEP posits that the brain constantly updates its internal models to minimize prediction errors, which involves assigning precision (confidence) to different sources of information. In the context of SUD, there may be an aberrant precision weighting of reward-related cues. Individuals with addiction might overestimate the precision of drug-related rewards while underestimating the precision of non-drug rewards. This imbalance can lead to a heightened sensitivity to drug-related stimuli and a diminished response to other rewarding experiences. Imaging studies support this by showing changes in reward processing and a loss of phasic dopaminergic responses in addicted individuals, aligning with the reward-deficiency hypothesis.


2. Aberrant precision weighting: In SUDs, there may be an imbalance in how precision (confidence) is assigned to different information sources. Individuals with addiction might overestimate the precision of drug-related rewards while underestimating non-drug rewards. This can lead to heightened sensitivity to drug-related stimuli and diminished response to other rewarding experiences.

**Impulsive and Compulsive Behaviors**
Active inference models suggest that addiction is associated with characteristic patterns of impulsive and compulsive behaviors. Impulsivity in addiction can be understood as a failure to appropriately weigh the long-term consequences of actions, leading to a preference for immediate rewards despite potential negative outcomes. Compulsivity, on the other hand, emerges as a repetitive, habitual response to drug-related cues. These behaviors can be framed within the FEP as maladaptive strategies to minimize free energy, where the brain's predictions and actions become increasingly rigid and less responsive to changing environmental contingencies.

**Impaired learning processes**

Research using active inference models indicates that individuals with SUDs show impairments in learning from both positive and negative outcomes. Specifically:

   - They exhibit less precise action selection mechanisms
   - They have a lower learning rate from losses
   - They have a greater learning rate from gains

**Learning and Adaptation**
Research by Da Costa et al. (2020) using active inference models indicates that individuals with SUD show impairments in learning from both positive and negative outcomes. They exhibit less precise action selection mechanisms and a lower learning rate from losses, which could explain difficulties in adjusting behavior and maintaining optimal decision-making during and after treatment. This suggests that the brain's ability to update its internal models based on new information is compromised in addiction, leading to persistent maladaptive behaviors.

Inconsistent behavior patterns: The findings suggest a pattern of inconsistent behavior in response to positive outcomes in SUDs, combined with a tendency to attribute negative outcomes to chance. Individuals with SUDs fail to settle on a behavior strategy despite sufficient evidence of its success.

**Habit Formation and Maintenance**
The FEP also provides a framework for understanding how habits form and are maintained in addiction. Habits are learned by observing one's own goal-directed behavior and are selected online during active inference. In addiction, the repeated use of substances reinforces habitual responses, making it difficult to break the cycle of addiction. This process involves both explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) behaviors, where the brain seeks to resolve ambiguity and maximize rewards. Over time, the habitual use of substances becomes a dominant strategy for minimizing free energy, even when it is no longer adaptive.



**Conclusion**
The free energy principle and active inference framework offer a comprehensive computational model for understanding substance use disorder. By focusing on maladaptive decision-making processes, aberrant precision weighting, and the transition from goal-directed to habitual behaviors, these frameworks provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying addiction. This approach not only aligns with existing empirical evidence but also offers a unifying theoretical framework that can guide future research and inform intervention strategies to address the complex nature of addiction.
