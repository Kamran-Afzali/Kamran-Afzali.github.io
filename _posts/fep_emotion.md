The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been proposed as a unified account of perception, learning, and action, with potential applications in emotion recognition and inference devices (Demekas, 2020). Joffily (2013) defines emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free energy over time, suggesting a dynamic interaction between valence and learning rate. Yanagisawa (2021) further explores the relationship between arousal potential and its factors, proposing a mathematical model that explains emotional arousal using minimized free energy. Hohwy (2020) argues that the FEP offers a conceptual and mathematical analysis of the existence of self-organizing systems, providing a new type of solution to problems in neurobiology, cognitive science, and philosophy.

The concept of free-energy, rooted in information theory, serves as an upper bound on surprise when sampling data based on a generative model of their causes. According to the free-energy principle, which posits that adaptive agents must minimize their free-energy to resist disorder, biological agents encode probabilistic models of the causes of their sensations. This principle is grounded in the understanding that minimizing free-energy can be interpreted as minimizing the prediction error between actual and predicted sensory inputs, especially under Gaussian assumptions. Adaptive agents achieve this minimization through two main tactics: adjusting their internal states for more accurate predictions and acting on the environment to sample sensations that align with their predictions. Importantly, perceptual inference, perceptual learning, and active inference all rely on the same Bayesian scheme, wherein agents infer the causes of sensory inputs, learn the relationship between inputs and causes, and act on the world to fulfill prior expectations about sensory inputs, respectively. Computational implementations of the free-energy principle have demonstrated significant overlap with neural mechanisms and cortical organization in the brain.

In the process of inferring and learning the causes of their sensations in a dynamic environment, adaptive agents encounter various forms of uncertainty: estimation uncertainty, volatility, and unexpected uncertainty. Estimation uncertainty pertains to the known estimation variance of states of the world causing sensory inputs and can be mitigated through learning. Volatility refers to slow and continuous changes in states of the world, often modeled by linking estimation uncertainty to a latent stochastic process. Unexpected uncertainty arises from surprising sensory inputs caused by discrete and rapid changes in states of the world, necessitating the resetting of learning from new sensory data. Dealing with these forms of uncertainty is crucial for Bayesian models of learning in non-stationary environments, presenting a significant challenge for dynamically updating beliefs about the world to optimize predictions.

Despite the acknowledged influence of emotions on beliefs and their resistance to modification, computational models have largely overlooked or failed to integrate emotional aspects. Emotional valence, representing the positive or negative character of emotion, has been central in emotion research, encompassing various facets such as elicitors, subjective experiences, and expressive behaviors. Valence plays a pivotal role in demarcating emotion and is considered a core dimension of subjective experiences of moods and emotions. Traditionally, mood, characterized by a lack of clear referent, slow changes, and extended duration, has been distinguished from emotion.

This foundational understanding of free-energy minimization and its relation to uncertainty, combined with the recognition of emotional valence as a critical aspect of subjective experiences, sets the stage for integrating emotions into computational models of adaptive agents. Such integration holds promise for a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and cognition in dynamic environments.

To bridge the gap between the biological principle of minimizing free-energy in agents at equilibrium with their environment and the traditional understanding of human behavior driven by pleasure-seeking and pain-avoidance, we've established a framework that links positive and negative emotional experiences to changes in free-energy over time. In this continuous time domain, the rate of change of free-energy \( F(t) \) is represented by its first time-derivative \( F'(t) \) at time \( t \). We formally define the valence of a state visited by an agent at time \( t \) as the negative first time-derivative of free-energy at that state, or simply \( F'(t) \).

Adaptive agents encode a hierarchical generative model of the causes of their sensations, where states of increasing complexity are encoded in higher levels of the hierarchy and sensory data are encoded at the lowest level. Free-energy is minimized independently for each level of the hierarchy, and \( F_i(t) \) represents the free-energy associated with the hidden state at the \( i \)-th level.

According to our definition of emotional valence, when \( F'_i(t) \) is positive (indicating an increase in free-energy over time at level \( i \) of the hierarchy), the valence of the state at this level is negative at time \( t \). Conversely, when \( F'_i(t) \) is negative (indicating a decrease in free-energy over time at level \( i \)), the valence of the state is positive at time \( t \). Neutral valenced states, where \( F'_i(t) \) is zero, may also exhibit low or high levels of surprise, as free-energy serves as an upper bound on surprise.

Emotional valence can be independently attributed to each state in the model, allowing for concurrent elicitation of positive and negative valences for the same sensation. Free-energy and its rate of change are influenced not only by current sensations but also by posterior beliefs about the causes of those sensations, making free-energy dynamics context-sensitive.

Cognitive theories of emotion have often relied on beliefs about states of affairs for their analyses. Emotions like happiness, unhappiness, relief, and disappointment are associated with certain (firm) beliefs about states of affairs, while emotions like hope and fear are related to uncertain beliefs. These two classes of emotions have been termed factive and epistemic, respectively.

To illustrate the difference between factive and epistemic emotions, consider the example of Lucia waiting for a train. Lucia is happy if she desires the train to be on time and firmly believes it is, unhappy if she doesn't desire it to be on time and firmly believes it is, hopeful if she desires it to be on time but is uncertain, and fearful if she doesn't desire it to be on time but is uncertain. Relief and disappointment, on the other hand, are associated with transitions from uncertain to certain beliefs.

In our framework, beliefs and desires can be related to bottom-up conditional expectations and top-down predictions, respectively, in a predictive coding scheme of free-energy minimization. Avoiding the assumption of certain beliefs inherent in cognitive theories, we focus solely on the dynamics of free-energy, showing that factive and epistemic emotions are associated with low and high levels of uncertainty, respectively.

In the continuous time domain, the rate of change of the first time-derivative of free-energy \( F'_i(t) \) at the \( i \)-th level is the second time-derivative of free-energy. Analogously to mechanical physics, \( F'_i(t) \) and \( F''_i(t) \) represent the velocity and acceleration of free-energy at time \( t \), respectively. We propose that when both \( F'_i(t) \) and \( F''_i(t) \) are negative, indicating a decrease in free-energy 'faster and faster' over time, the agent hopes to visit a state of lower free-energy in the near future at level \( i \). Conversely, when \( F'_i(t) \) is negative and \( F''_i(t) \) is positive, the agent is happy to be visiting a state of lower free-energy than before at this level.

Similarly, when both \( F'_i(t) \) and \( F''_i(t) \) are positive, indicating an increase in free-energy 'faster and faster' over time, the agent fears visiting a state of greater free-energy in the near future. However, when \( F'_i(t) \) is positive and \( F''_i(t) \) is negative, the agent is unhappy to be visiting a state of higher free-energy than before.

Transitions between emotional states follow a pattern, with transitions from negative to positive emotions passing through relief and transitions from positive to negative emotions passing through disappointment. However, transitions between emotions of the same valence can occur bidirectionally. Each basic emotion is mapped onto a particular region of a two-dimensional space defined by the first and second time-derivatives of free-energy, illustrating the complex relationship between affective states and free-energy dynamics.
