The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been proposed as a unified account of perception, learning, and action, with potential applications in emotion recognition and inference devices (Demekas, 2020). Joffily (2013) defines emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free energy over time, suggesting a dynamic interaction between valence and learning rate. Yanagisawa (2021) further explores the relationship between arousal potential and its factors, proposing a mathematical model that explains emotional arousal using minimized free energy. Hohwy (2020) argues that the FEP offers a conceptual and mathematical analysis of the existence of self-organizing systems, providing a new type of solution to problems in neurobiology, cognitive science, and philosophy.

Free-energy is an information theoretic quantity that upper bounds the surprise on sampling some data, given a generative model of how data were caused. The free-energy principle assumes that biological agents encode a probabilistic model of the causes of their sensations, and postulates that any adaptive agent that resists a tendency to disorder must minimize its free-energy [1,2]. Under simplifying (Gaussian) assumptions, free-energy minimization can be understood as the minimization of the prediction error between the actual and predicted sensory inputs. In order to comply with the free-energy principle, adaptive agents have two tactics at their disposal: (1) adjusting their internal states to generate more accurate predictions and (2) acting on the environment to sample sensations that fulfil their predictions. The principle is based upon the realization that perceptual inference and learning [3,4] and active inference [5,6] rest on the same Bayesian scheme. Perceptual inference refers to inferring the states of the world causing sensory inputs. Perceptual learning relates to learning the relationship between inputs and causes. Active inference corre sponds to acting on the world to fulfil prior expectations about sensory inputs. The computational implementation of the free energy principle has been shown to replicate in many aspects neural mechanisms and the cortical organization of the brain [4,7]. 
Crucially, when inferring and learning the causes of their sensations in a changing world, adaptive agents need to deal with different forms of uncertainty, namely estimation uncertainty [8], volatility [9,10] and unexpected uncertainty [11,12]. Estimation uncertainty refers to the known estimation variance of states of the world causing sensory inputs and can be reduced through 
learning. Volatility refers to slow and continuous changes in states of the world, and has usually been modelled by making estimation uncertainty follow some latent stochastic process [13]. Finally, unexpected uncertainty arises from surprising sensory inputs caused by discrete and fast changes in states of the world, and calls for forgetting the past and restarting learning from new sensory data. Dealing with different forms of uncertainty is fundamental to Bayesian models of learning in a non-stationary environment [14]. In fact, a critical challenge faced by many recent Bayesian schemes of human learning is how to dynamically update beliefs about states of the world in order to optimize predictions in a changing environment [9–12,15–18]. 
Despite the major role attributed to emotions in influencing the content and the strength of the agent’s beliefs and the resistance of these beliefs to modification [19], emotion has not been considered in - much less integrated into - these computational models. The concept of emotional valence, or simply valence, has been used among emotion researchers to refer to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects, including elicitors (events, objects), subjective experiences (feeling, affect) and expressive behaviours (facial, bodily, verbal) [20]. The valence of feelings has been argued to be a pivotal criterion for demarcating emotion [21] and a core dimension of the subjective experience of moods and emotions [22]. Traditionally, mood has been defined, in contrast to emotion, as an affective state that lacks a clear referent, changes slowly and lasts for an extended period of time [23].
