The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has been proposed as a unified account of perception, learning, and action, with potential applications in emotion recognition and inference devices (Demekas, 2020). Joffily (2013) defines emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free energy over time, suggesting a dynamic interaction between valence and learning rate. Yanagisawa (2021) further explores the relationship between arousal potential and its factors, proposing a mathematical model that explains emotional arousal using minimized free energy. Hohwy (2020) argues that the FEP offers a conceptual and mathematical analysis of the existence of self-organizing systems, providing a new type of solution to problems in neurobiology, cognitive science, and philosophy.
