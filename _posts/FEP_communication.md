### Language and communication

**Language and communication** are critical components of collective behavior, serving as the bridge that connects individual agents within a group and enables the emergence of coordinated, intelligent action. Within the framework of **collective active inference** and **group-level free energy minimization**, language and communication are not merely tools for exchanging information but are fundamental processes that shape the very fabric of social interaction and cultural evolution. When applied to groups, active inference extends to include distributed cognition, joint belief updating, and coordinated action, all of which hinge critically on communication (Kaufmann et al., 2021). Through structured linguistic exchanges, groups can refine shared generative models, facilitating better coordination and reducing free energy at the collective level (Ramstead et al., 2018). This post explores the relationship between language/communication, and collective intelligence, emphasizing how these phenomena arise from the basic principles of **active inference** and **free energy minimization**.

In a social context, **language and communication** play a crucial role in minimizing free energy by enabling agents to share their internal models and coordinate their actions. When agents can communicate effectively, they can pool their knowledge, correct each other's errors, and make more accurate predictions about the world. This leads to a reduction in overall uncertainty and a more robust, adaptive collective. Language serves as a medium for synchronizing internal models among individuals within a group. From an active inference perspective, language can be viewed as an externalized generative model that enables predictive processing across multiple agents (Heyes, 2018). This allows individuals to share expectations, negotiate meaning, and establish conventions that reduce epistemic uncertainty. Through these exchanges, collective entities maintain coherence in their interactions with the environment, enabling large-scale coordination (Friston et al., 2024).

**Communication** is often framed as a process of reducing uncertainty about the world, drawing conversation partners closer through intersubjective reference frames, where communication emerges as a means of **mutual attunement**, wherein agents actively infer each other's internal belief states and update their own representations accordingly. The natural result of this bidirectional inference is the synchronization of belief states within the cultural ensemble.  The emergence of cumulative culture is one of the most compelling examples of how communication facilitates collective active inference. According to Kastel et al. (2022), communication enables the transmission of learned priors across generations, contributing to cultural evolution and the refinement of adaptive behaviors. When individuals communicate, they are not just exchanging information but actively co-constructing shared probabilistic models of the world. This process enables the progressive accumulation of knowledge and the optimization of collective behavior, ensuring that groups remain adaptive to their environment (Levchuk et al., 2018).

One key element in this framework is the concept of a **shared generative model**. A generative model is an internal representation of the world that allows agents to make predictions about their sensory experiences. When agents share a common generative model, they can readily interpret each other's signals and integrate them into their own belief updating processes. This shared understanding facilitates coordination and cooperation, allowing the collective to achieve goals that would be impossible for individual agents acting in isolation. **Belief-sharing plays a crucial role in resolving uncertainty about hidden states**, particularly when observable consequences are only visible to one agent at a time. By communicating their beliefs, agents can collectively build a more complete and accurate representation of their environment, reducing uncertainty and improving decision-making. Communication, in this context, involves not only the content of beliefs but also the confidence with which they are held. **Linguistic communication emerges as agents broadcast their beliefs, increasing the accuracy of their world models and enhancing communication efficiency**. As agents interact and exchange information, they collectively refine their understanding of the world, leading to the emergence of shared meanings and conventions. The structure of language reflects the structure of the underlying generative model and is constrained by the causal structure of the lived world.

Communication also plays a key role in the regulation of group-level free energy minimization by establishing epistemic boundaries—demarcations that define what is relevant within a given social context (Constant et al., 2019). These boundaries, operationalized through linguistic categories and narratives, shape perception and action by constraining the space of possible interpretations. In this way, language functions as a scaffold that both simplifies and enriches the collective generative model, ensuring that social agents remain synchronized in their expectations and responses to the world (Bruineberg et al., 2018). A particularly interesting dimension of language in active inference is its role in normativity and social change. Buskell (2020) argues that linguistic communication is essential for negotiating social norms and modifying collective priors. Through discourse, groups can challenge existing generative models and introduce new inferential structures that alter patterns of belief and behavior. This capacity for reflective self-modification underscores the flexibility of collective active inference and highlights how language is not just a medium for transmitting knowledge but a mechanism for reshaping the cognitive landscape of groups (Veissière et al., 2019).

The complexity of language allows humans to convey not only the content of beliefs but also the **confidence** in those beliefs. Communication in this sense is more than just the transmission of information; it includes the nuances and subtleties that allow for a deeper understanding between individuals. This deeper exchange can lead to the emergence of shared expectations and narratives that reduce free energy. However, **efficient communication** is not without its challenges. The environment itself does not impose the practical constraints that drive real-life human behaviors. The model can be expanded to include practical constraints and real-world dynamics to address these issues. Furthermore, indirect information sharing can introduce the risk of amplifying noisy or irrelevant information, leading to maladaptive group outcomes. Communication relies on agents having precise **likelihood mappings**, and agents acquire these mappings because they expect to acquire them. The convergence to a common ground or frame of reference is mediated by free energy selection processes at the level of the model structure, using Bayesian model reduction.

One example of this process can be applied to the creation and use of language can be seen as a process of **scientific niche construction (SNC)**, wherein the environment is modified to influence expectations and drive actions aimed at confirming hypotheses. In this view, models guide the collection of new evidence, and new evidence refines the models, creating an ongoing cycle of hypothesis generation, evidence collection, and hypothesis revision that drives scientific progress. In the context of niche construction, language serves as a cultural artifact that shapes the environment in which inference takes place (Hesp et al., 2019). Through repeated use, linguistic structures become embedded in social practices, externalizing aspects of cognition and enabling more efficient coordination. As Friston et al. (2019) suggest, language can be considered a form of epistemic engineering—an adaptive mechanism that structures inference at both individual and collective levels. This perspective aligns with Kirchhoff et al. (2018), who propose that the Markov blankets defining social systems are partially constituted by linguistic constructs that delineate informational boundaries within groups. By enabling agents to share their internal models, coordinate their actions, and learn from each other's experiences, language and communication facilitate the minimization of free energy at both the individual and collective levels. As agents engage in these processes, they contribute to the creation of shared knowledge, the evolution of cultural norms, and the ability of collectives to solve complex problems and adapt to changing environments. 

Language and communication are foundational to collective intelligence, serving not merely as conduits for information exchange but as mechanisms for constructing, synchronizing, and refining shared generative models. Within the framework of **collective active inference** and **free energy minimization**, these processes enable groups to jointly reduce uncertainty, align their internal states, and coordinate action more effectively than any individual agent could alone. Language emerges as a form of **epistemic engineering**, shaping the informational landscape and cultural structures in which agents operate. It allows for mutual attunement, transmission of priors across generations, and negotiation of social norms—thus playing a central role in both cognitive coordination and cultural evolution.

Despite its powerful role in supporting collective inference, language-based communication introduces several challenges. Effective communication requires precise likelihood mappings and shared reference frames, both of which are difficult to establish in complex or novel social contexts. Moreover, indirect or noisy information transmission can lead to **maladaptive inference**, amplifying errors and undermining group cohesion. Real-world dynamics—such as power imbalances, misinformation, or differing epistemic standards—further complicate the idealized models of communication often used in theoretical frameworks. These challenges highlight the necessity of integrating more realistic environmental and social constraints into models of collective inference.

Looking ahead, future research must address these complexities by extending current models to incorporate the **pragmatic constraints of real-world communication**. This includes developing formal tools to better understand how shared generative models evolve, how epistemic boundaries are negotiated, and how linguistic structures co-evolve with social systems. Moreover, interdisciplinary work bridging neuroscience, anthropology, and computational modeling will be essential to refining our understanding of how language not only transmits beliefs but actively shapes the structure and function of collective minds. By embracing the full complexity of language as both a cognitive and cultural artifact, we can better understand how human groups navigate uncertainty, adapt to changing environments, and construct shared worlds.
