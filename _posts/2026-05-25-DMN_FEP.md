### **The Default Mode Network and Psychoanalytic Concepts in Active Inference**

#### **1. Introduction**

Psychoanalysis, from its Freudian origins, has attempted to elucidate the intricate relationship between the human mind and its neurobiological underpinnings. Freud's early forays into grounding psychological concepts in neurophysiology, exemplified by his *Project for a Scientific Psychology*, faced limitations due to the technological constraints of his time. However, the advent of neural networks, neuroimaging techniques, and the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** has breathed new life into the endeavor of understanding the brain as the physical embodiment of the psyche. This essay aims to explore the alignment between the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, a prominent area of study in contemporary neuroscience, and core psychoanalytical concepts, all viewed through the lens of active inference and free energy minimization.

To do so, we will first establish the foundations of neuropsychoanalysis and the FEP. We will then analyze the structural and functional aspects of the DMN in relation to Freudian metapsychology, focusing on constructs like the ego, id, and repression. We will conclude with a critical evaluation of current limitations and possible future directions.



#### **2. Neuropsychoanalysis and the Free Energy Principle**

Neuropsychoanalysis is an interdisciplinary field that integrates Freudian psychoanalytic concepts with contemporary neuroscience. One of the most promising frameworks for understanding this intersection is the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference.

The **Free Energy Principle**, developed by Friston (2010), is a theoretical model stating that biological systems resist entropy by minimizing "free energy"—a formal measure of surprise or prediction error—through continuous model updating. **Active inference** refers to the process by which agents act on the environment to confirm or revise their internal models by minimizing this prediction error. In computational terms, **precision** refers to the confidence in a prediction, which governs how much weight is given to sensory data versus internal beliefs. The modulation of precision is crucial in emotion regulation and defense mechanisms.

When applied to psychoanalysis, FEP offers a novel way to interpret core psychoanalytic constructs such as repression, the unconscious, and the id-ego-superego dynamics. As we discussed in an earlier post, in a psychoanalytic context, this means that unconscious defense mechanisms, such as repression and denial, can be understood as mechanisms that minimize free energy by constraining prediction errors. Freud's notion of the unconscious can thus be seen as a set of deeply ingrained predictive models that shape an individual's interpretation of reality while remaining inaccessible to conscious awareness.



#### **3. The Default Mode Network and the Ego**

One of the earliest discussions linking psychoanalysis to predictive processing comes from Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010), who argue that Freudian ideas align with the brain’s hierarchical organization. The **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, a large-scale brain network associated with self-referential thinking and mind-wandering, has been implicated in ego-functions such as self-regulation and autobiographical memory.

Under this framework, the **ego** can be conceptualized as a hierarchical predictive model that balances internal drives (the id) with social constraints (the superego). This balance is maintained by modulating precision, or the weight given to prediction errors, which aligns with the concept of repression. In active inference terms, the ego dynamically regulates precision to either amplify or dampen sensory prediction errors in accordance with internalized beliefs and external demands.

The DMN, a network primarily encompassing the **medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)**, **posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)**, and **inferior parietal lobule (IPL)**, exhibits heightened activity during rest and self-referential thought. This network has been linked to the Freudian concept of the **ego**, which mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the constraints of the external world. The **MPFC-PCC connectivity** is absent in infants and develops through ontogeny, which parallels the emergence of the individual Self with its complex functions. Furthermore, some researchers have defined the DMN as a kind of biomarker of the Self.



#### **4. The Id, Primary Process Thinking, and the Limbic System**

In contrast to the ego, the **id** represents the unconscious reservoir of instinctual drives and desires, operating on the pleasure principle. Neurobiologically, the id can be associated with subcortical structures such as the **amygdala** and **hypothalamus**, which are central to processing emotions and basic drives. These structures operate at a primary process level, characterized by high entropy and a lack of logical constraints.

Failures of top-down control from the DMN might be associated with an impairment of the supraordinate system, leading to the expression of unconstrained activity from the limbic system. Such failures are observed in non-ordinary states of consciousness such as early and acute psychosis, temporal-lobe aura, dreaming, and hallucinogenic drug states. These phenomena provide clinical and phenomenological evidence for the interplay between the ego (DMN) and the id (limbic system) as described by psychoanalysis.

Furthermore, the DMN interacts with other large-scale networks, such as the **salience network (SN)** and **central executive network (CEN)**, to regulate attention and emotional responses. This interaction is crucial in balancing internal cognitive processes with external stimuli, a dynamic that is central to both psychoanalytic theory and active inference. The DMN’s role in integrating past experiences and generating expectations aligns with Freud’s notion of the unconscious mind shaping behavior outside of conscious awareness.



#### **5. Primary and Secondary Process Thinking in Predictive Coding**

A key psychoanalytic concept that finds resonance within the FEP framework is the distinction between **primary** and **secondary process thinking**. Freud proposed that the primary process, associated with the id, is governed by pleasure-seeking and operates outside of logical constraints, while the secondary process, mediated by the ego, adheres to reality and structured thought.

Solms (2013) argues that these processes can be mapped onto different modes of brain activity, with the DMN supporting spontaneous, unconstrained thought and the central executive network enabling goal-directed reasoning. Active inference provides a computational basis for this distinction by describing how different levels of **precision weighting** can shift between automatic, implicit processing (primary) and explicit, effortful cognition (secondary). In Bayesian terms, high precision on priors corresponds to rigidity (e.g., obsession), while high precision on sensory input may underlie anxiety or psychosis.



#### **6. Interoception, Emotion, and the Unconscious**

Similarly, the role of **interoception**—the brain’s ability to sense the internal physiological state of the body—is crucial in understanding how emotional and affective states are regulated within the predictive brain model. The regulation of interoceptive signals is fundamental to maintaining homeostasis and resolving unconscious conflicts.

Hopkins (2012) explores how interoceptive predictions influence unconscious conflict resolution, aligning psychoanalytic interpretations of anxiety with contemporary neurobiological accounts. One of the key aspects of this integration is the role of the DMN, a large-scale brain network associated with self-referential thinking, mind-wandering, and the processing of autobiographical memories.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, the DMN can be seen as playing a role in unconscious processes, particularly in the formation and maintenance of defense mechanisms. Freudian concepts such as repression and projection can be examined through the lens of active inference, where the brain minimizes prediction errors by selectively inhibiting or modifying incoming information. The DMN, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, appears to be involved in these processes, as it modulates self-related information and emotional regulation. Studies have shown that alterations in DMN activity are linked to various psychiatric conditions, such as depression and PTSD, where maladaptive prediction models contribute to pathological thought patterns.

#### **8. Conclusion and Critical Reflections**

In conclusion, the integration of the Default Mode Network with psychoanalytic concepts through the Free Energy Principle offers a unifying framework for understanding self-referential cognition, emotional regulation, and unconscious processes. The DMN, particularly its medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions, supports autobiographical memory, theory of mind, and internal narrative construction—functions that parallel Freudian notions of the ego and defense mechanisms like repression. By minimizing prediction errors through active inference, the DMN maintains psychological homeostasis, balancing primal drives (id) with external reality (superego).

However, this synthesis faces several theoretical and practical challenges:

* **Ontological ambiguity**: Psychoanalytic constructs like the ego or repression are not always reducible to single neural circuits or functions.
* **Empirical validation**: Many of the proposed mappings remain speculative without direct experimental tests.
* **Clinical translation**: While promising, applying FEP-informed models in clinical settings demands reliable biomarkers and intervention targets.

Pathological conditions such as schizophrenia involve **hyperactive DMN dynamics**, potentially due to failed repression mechanisms and excess free energy. Likewise, PTSD and depression can be conceptualized as disorders of maladaptive precision weighting and rigid predictive models.

Ethical and technical hurdles also arise in translating theoretical models into clinical interventions, particularly in distinguishing adaptive from maladaptive prediction mechanisms. Future directions should prioritize cross-disciplinary research to refine computational models of DMN-FEP dynamics, such as simulating affective systems inspired by Panksepp’s frameworks or developing neurofeedback therapies targeting DMN modulation. Exploring DMN plasticity through **psychedelics**, **dream research**, or **contemplative practices** (e.g., mindfulness) could yield novel treatments for disorders rooted in rigid predictive models. These efforts may ultimately deepen our understanding of **consciousness**, **selfhood**, and **mental health** in a unified psychobiological paradigm.
