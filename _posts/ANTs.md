Originally, the ANTs framework provided open-source functionality for deformable image registration with small or large deformations, as
shown in figure 1. Independent evaluation of the 0.0 version of ANTs software, applied to “control” data,
placed the toolkit as a top performer amongst 14 methods [26]. Developer evaluation showed stronger differences
with other methodology in neurodegenerative neuroimaging data, where large deformation is required
[10]. ANTs has since grown to include N4 bias correction [37], additional evaluation of multiple modalities
and organ systems [36, 38, 28], univariate or multivariate image segmentation [19, 40], tighter integration
with the Insight ToolKit [35, 17], a well-evaluated cortical thickness pipeline [41] and, more recently,
visualization tools and integration with R[42]. ANTs serves as both a core library for further algorithm
development and also as a command-line application-oriented toolkit. ANTs also has a permissive software
license that allows it to be employed freely by industry [31]. ANTs enables diffeomorphic normalization
with a variety of transformation models, optimal template construction, multiple types of diffeomorphisms,
multivariate similarity metrics, diffusion tensor processing and warping, image segmentation with and with out priors and measurement of cortical thickness from probabilistic segmentations. The normalization tools, alone, provide a near limitless range of functionality and allow the user to develop customized objective functions.
