## Three Pages
This document provides an in-depth exploration of academic programs in health informatics across five countries: Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. It spans various academic levels, including Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD, and Fellowships. Twelve universities were selected to present inspiring programs, in a diversity of settings. To note, digital health training is closely aligned with jurisdictional and local configurations, and examples are presented here to highlight institutional trajectories and choices toward creating new programs at the confluence of disciplines. It is not an exhaustive repertory of programs. A select group of twelve universities are featured, each offering specialized degrees aimed at meeting the increasing demand for skilled professionals in health information management and digital healthcare.
A noter, la formation en santé numérique fait référence à plusieurs domaines, qui recoupent à la fois les sciences de l’information en santé (health informatics), désigné aussi par biomedical informatics, les sciences des données de santé, la gestion de l’information en santé (health information management), les soins virtuels et la télésanté (virtual care and telehealth). Les formations présentées ici couvrent donc l’ensemble de ces domaines, mais excluent les formations en bio-informatique et en génie, bien que plusieurs chevauchements existent aussi dans certaines universités. De plus, plusieurs certificats ou programmes courts de certification existent aussi, mais n’ont pas fait l’objet d’une analyse. 
Beginning with undergraduate programs, three training programs are identified among the twelve universities. These programs, often collaborative efforts between different faculties and departments, lay the foundation for students with interdisciplinary courses covering database design, analytics, healthcare delivery systems, and information security. Among the programs the University of Victoria in Canada stands out with its BSc in Health Information Science, which offers a combined major in Computer Science and Health Information Science. This interdisciplinary approach equips students with a diverse skill set spanning both technical and healthcare domains. Similarly, the University of Chicago Illinois in the USA offers a Bachelor of Science program in Health Information Management (BSHIM), which is accredited by CAHIIM, ensuring quality education aligned with industry standards.

Moving to the master’s level, the twelve universities provide advanced courses and research opportunities in health informatics (or relate fields) at this level. Collaborative efforts between faculties and departments, exemplified by partnerships like the transatlantic collaboration between McGill University and Université de Bordeaux, highlight the interdisciplinary nature of modern health informatics education that can go beyond the limits of a given departemmnt, faculty, University, or even country. 
Likewise, several American institutions offer master’s programs accredited by professional organizations like CAHIIM, AIMA, and HIMSS, ensuring educational standards aligned with industry needs. One could regroupe the presented masters programs into four categories: Biomedical informatics (presented by University of Buffalo, Harvard); Health Informatics/Clinical Informatics (presented by University of Victoria, University of Leeds, University of Chicago, Stanford); Digital Health/eHealth (presented by McMaster University, University of Sydney, University of Denver, Oxford); Health Data Science (presented by Université de Bordeaux, University of Denver). 
The only one program that can not be integrated to above mentioned categories is Université Paris Cité with their stand out program in Cybersécurity et eHealth.

At the doctoral level, six training programs focus on advanced research in health informatics/Digital Health. Candidates pursuing PhDs, DPhils, or Doctor of Pharmacy degrees. More specifically, University of Victoria, PhD in health informatics; Oxford Institute of Digital Health, DPhil in Translational Health; Université de Bordeaux PhD Public Health Data Science; University of Chicago Illinois MS in Health Informatics followed by Doctor of Pharmacy; Stanford University, PhD in Biomedical Informatics; University of Buffalo, PhD Biomedical informatics. This overview underscores the diverse educational opportunities available globally focusing research-driven approaches to address complex healthcare challenges. Each program is tailored to meet the evolving needs of the healthcare industry and prepare future professionals to navigate the complexities of digital healthcare systems.

Beyond the traditional health informatic academic pathway, specialized programs cater to healthcare professionals seeking to increase clinical expertise with informatics skills. Medical residencies and fellowships in health informatics. In Canada, an interdisciplinary effort by University of Victoria offers a unique Double Degree Master of Nursing and Master of Science in Health Informatics to train the next generation of nursing graduates who are well versed in both patient care and health informatic systems. On the other hand, three American universities provide clinical/biomedical informatics fellowship programs for medical residents, offering hands-on training and research opportunities in the field. These programs, offered by institutions such as Harvard University, Stanford, and the University of Buffalo, aim to equip medical doctors with the necessary informatics skills to enhance healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes.

In terms on the presented courses, Health informatics/Bio informatics/ Digital health programs presented in this document offer a diverse array of courses that can be broadly categorized into several main themes. Here we present a high level descriptions of the most recurring themes. The first theme revolves around foundational knowledge, introducing students to essential concepts in health informatics. This includes courses like “Health Informatics: An Overview” and “Health Information Systems Design.” These courses aim to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the technological infrastructure supporting healthcare data management. The second theme addresses research skills and evidence-based practices, as demonstrated by courses such as “Research Methods in Health Informatics” and “Disciplinary Research”. These courses highlight the importance of generating and utilizing evidence to inform decision-making in health informatics, ensuring that professionals can contribute meaningfully to advancements in the field. The third theme involves technological competencies, reflecting the evolving landscape of health informatics. Courses like “Programming for Healthcare” and “Artificial Intelligence in Health Care” highlight the need for professionals to possess advanced technical skills, including programming, database management, and an understanding of artificial intelligence, to address complex challenges in healthcare. The fourth theme centers around professional development and ethical considerations. Courses like “Professional Identity” and “Ethics for Health System Transformation” emphasize the importance of cultivating a strong professional identity and ethical decision-making within the broader healthcare context. It is noteworthy that clinical competency and understanding are a crucial component in health informatics programs, bridging the gap between healthcare practice and information technology. Various aspects of clinical competencies are embedded within the curriculum, especially in courses focused on healthcare delivery, patient safety, and the application of informatics in clinical settings. Finally , there is a managerial and leadership component, evident in courses such as “Organizational Behavior and Change Management” and “Project Management.” These courses recognize the significance of effective leadership and management skills in implementing health informatics solutions within complex healthcare environments. Overall, the synthesis of these courses reveals a holistic approach in health informatics programs, combining foundational knowledge, research skills, technological competencies, ethical considerations, and leadership training.
