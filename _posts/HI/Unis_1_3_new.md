## Summary by jurisdictions and universities 

This document provides an in-depth exploration of academic programs in health informatics across five countries: Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. It spans various academic levels, including Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD, and Fellowships. Twelve universities were selected to present inspiring programs in a diversity of settings. With digital health training being closely aligned with jurisdictional and local configurations, examples here are presented to highlight institutional trajectories and choices toward creating new programs at the confluence of disciplines. This document is not an exhaustive repertory of programs, only a select group of universities are featured, each offering specialized degrees aimed at meeting the increasing demand for skilled professionals in health information management and digital healthcare. It should be noted that training in digital health refers to several fields, including health informatics (also known as biomedical informatics), health data science, health information management, virtual care and telehealth. The training courses presented here therefore cover all these fields, but exclude bioinformatics and engineering training, although several overlaps also exist at certain universities. In addition, several certificates or short certification programs also exist, but have not been included in this document. 


### USA 

####  Medical schools 

In the United States, in absence of a centeralized and unfied effort, some medical schools have been reported to offer digital health courses. This can go from support for individual research and development projects to formal curricular integration as a “digital health track”. Several studies have been published (see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6971961/)) on the subject and some universities have begun introducing a new component of the medical education curriculum to current medical students to enhance the instruction in [Digital Health and Data Science](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/md-education/curriculum/components/index.html).


#### Selected Universities

In the United States, we selected five universities. 

CAHIIM (The Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics & Information Management Education) is the accreditation body for health informatics and health information management programs that covers three domains (health informatics, health information management, digital health) and recognizes some of the programs presented below. The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) also recognize official educational affiliate organizations across the US. The Denver University is an HIMSS official educational organization for their three graduate programs (health data science, project management et health informatics, telehealth and virtual care). Moreover, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) which is an academic association formally recognize the Buffalo university’s programs in biomedical informatics

### Canada 

No formal Canadian accreditation body was found 

####  Medical schools 

- There is a need to educate family medicine residents in the realm of health informatics, data analytics, and general principles of digital health technologies. However, the integration of health informatics concepts into the curricula of Canadian medical schools and residencies is proceeding slowly (see [here](https://www.cfp.ca/content/65/10/683)). There are offeres by medical associations to improve digital health training in medical schools, for instance [OMD](https://www.ontariomd.ca/documents/resource%20library/dig.%20health%20education%20for%20med%20school.pdf) proposes a Digital Health Curriculum that medical schools can leverage to deliver further value to your students. This digital health educational package includes well-defined instructional digital health materials developed by practicing physicians and digital health experts who are university faculty members. Each module in the curriculum is specifically designed to enhance experiential learning and can be easily customized to the learning goals of each university’s medical school and the student’s education year.  

#### Selected Universities

We selected two Canadian Universities each with its own unique focus and approach. 

#### Victoria 

The University of Victoria is home to Canada's first School of Health Information Science, offering a range of innovative programs. The double undergraduate program in Computer Sciences and Health Informatics provides a comprehensive foundation in both fields.

### Australia 

####  Medical schools 

- The Australian Medical Council (AMC) and the Australian Digital Health Agency formed a partnership in 2020 to engage in a project aimed at understanding how technology impacts the standards of medical education, training and practice in Australia. This was done in alignment with the AMC’s roles as a national standards body for medical education and training, and as the accreditation authority for the medical profession.  AMC completed this work by launching the [framework](https://www.amc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Digital-Health-in-Medicine-Capability-Framework-FINAL-18-Oct-2021.pdf) with medical education providers and other key stakeholders of medicine. As part of this launch, AMC also presented on the capability framework at a number of national medical education and workforce conferences and shared a new look digital health page with their stakeholders.

### France 

####  Medical schools 

At the start of the 2024 academic year, digital health will make its appearance on the curriculum of the first cycle of health studies, as well as in university paramedical training courses. This is a logical next step, as medical faculties began teaching digital health to students in their second cycle (4th to 6th year) in 2019. More information can be found in the following articles.

### UK 


####  Medical schools 

- In recent investigations among UK healthcare professionals, notable discrepancies in digital literacy within the healthcare field have been identified. These disparities present obstacles to the efficient integration of emerging technologies in clinical practices. Moreover, insufficient training on the ethical considerations related to these technologies poses a potential dilemma for healthcare professionals in safeguarding patient rights. Recognizing these challenges and the evident need for focused education in digital health, a group pf UK medical doctors have recently [advocate for a concentrated effort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8966807/) on the fundamental component of any healthcare profession—the undergraduate curriculum.


#### Selected Universities

In the UK, we selected two universities of Oxford and Leeds.
