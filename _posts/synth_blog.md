**Why do we need is synthetic data in healthcare?**

The use of health data for innovation and care enhancement has been a longstanding aim within the sector. In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has opened up promising avenues for leveraging health data to provide decision support for clinicians, develop more effective treatments, and enhance overall system efficiency. However, despite the potential of these technologies, their widespread adoption faces significant challenges. One of the primary issues is the accessibility of data, with ML applications heavily relying on to large, high-quality datasets for training and validation. In the healthcare domain, where privacy regulations are tight and data sharing is often restricted, accessing such datasets can be particularly challenging. Privacy protection is another critical concern in the healthcare sector, governed by a set of regulations and ethical considerations. These regulations aim to safeguard the security and confidentiality of patient records by controlling the flow of information and preventing unauthorized access. Violations of these rules, often termed "invasions of privacy" or "privacy breaches," can have serious consequences, including the unauthorized disclosure of personal health information. Privacy threats in healthcare data can take various forms, including identity disclosure, attribute disclosure, and membership disclosure. Adversaries employ a range of techniques to compromise patient privacy, posing significant challenges to health data sharing and access. Privacy concerns have a profound impact on the sharing and accessibility of health data. One consequence of these concerns is the phenomenon known as the _"privacy chill"_ where the reluctance or refusal to share health data due to privacy concerns leads to a slowdown or complete restriction on data sharing initiatives. This phenomenon has been identified to have negative effects on various aspects of healthcare, including the response to health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the recruitment and retention of talented health data scientists. The privacy chill underscores the delicate balance between protecting patient privacy and facilitating data access for research and innovation in healthcare.

**What is Synthetic Data?**

To address the challenges faced by privacy concerns and data accessibility, researchers have explored the use of synthetic data in healthcare. Synthetic data refers to artificially generated data that replicates the statistical properties of real data while protecting privacy and confidentiality. The U.S. Census Bureau defines synthetic data as _new data values generated using statistical models_. Synthetic data can be broadly categorized into three types: fully synthetic, partially synthetic, and hybrid. Fully synthetic data involves creating entirely fabricated data without any real data, offering strong privacy control but limited analytic value due to the absence of real-world patterns. Partially synthetic data replaces sensitive variables with synthetic versions while retaining original values, striking a balance between privacy and utility. Hybrid synthetic data combines elements of both real and synthetic data, offering enhanced utility while still providing privacy protection. The categorization of synthetic data types aids in understanding the trade-offs between privacy and utility across different levels of replication and augmentation. For example, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK has delineated a detailed spectrum of synthetic data types, ranging from purely synthetic structural datasets with minimal analytic value and no disclosure risk to replica-level synthetically augmented datasets that closely mirror real data at the cost of higher disclosure risks. This spectrum offers insights into the varying utility and privacy aspects of synthetic data and provides researchers with options tailored to their specific needs and constraints.

**Utilizations of Synthetic Health Data**

Synthetic data generation presents a range of opportunities for addressing key challenges in healthcare data. One of the primary advantages of synthetic data is its ability to safeguard individual privacy and record confidentiality by generating data that is difficult to re-identify. By blending "fake" and original data, synthetic datasets strike a balance between utility and privacy, making them valuable for a wide range of applications. For researchers and data users, synthetic data enhances accessibility to health data by providing datasets with minimal disclosure risk. This opens doors for a broader array of users, accelerating research and innovation in healthcare. Furthermore, synthetic data fills the scarcity of realistic data for software development and testing. Synthetic datasets offer cost-effective and authentic test data for software applications, streamlining the development process and ensuring that applications perform as expected in real-world scenarios. As researchers continue to explore the applications of synthetic data, its benefits become increasingly apparent across various domains within healthcare. Synthetic data significantly streamlines the processes involved in training, testing, and deploying AI solutions, promoting more efficient and effective development.

**Challenges in Synthetic Health Data**

Despite the promise of synthetic data, its widespread adoption in healthcare faces several challenges. One of the primary challenges is evaluating the quality of synthetic data. Quality evaluation involves assessing fidelity, diversity, and generalization, among other factors. Fidelity refers to the extent to which synthetic data samples resemble real samples, while diversity ensures adequate coverage of the real data population. Generalization assesses the ability of synthetic data to accurately reflect real-world phenomena across different contexts. Evaluating synthetic data quality requires robust methodologies and validation frameworks to ensure that synthetic datasets meet the necessary criteria for use in healthcare applications.

Privacy implementation is another critical challenge in synthetic data generation. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for privacy breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. While synthetic data aims to protect privacy by generating data that is difficult to re-identify, there is a constant trade-off between privacy and utility. Achieving the right balance between privacy and utility is crucial for ensuring that synthetic data meets the needs of researchers and data users while safeguarding patient privacy.

Mitigating bias amplification is another significant challenge in synthetic data generation. Synthetic data inherits biases present in the real data on which it is based, and there is a risk of amplifying these biases during the generation process. Addressing biases and ensuring fairness in synthetic datasets requires validation frameworks and fairness-aware synthesis methods. These methods aim to minimize biases and ensure equitable representation of different subgroups within the synthetic data, promoting fairness and transparency in healthcare applications.

**What are the future Directions**

Despite these challenges, synthetic data generation holds great promise for transforming healthcare data infrastructure and research. Moving forward, it is essential to invest in research and development efforts to advance synthetic data techniques and validation frameworks. Bridging the accountability gap through privacy legislation and AI regulations is crucial for balancing innovation and privacy in healthcare. By addressing these challenges and maximizing the potential of synthetic data, researchers can unlock new opportunities for leveraging health data to improve patient care, advance medical research, and drive innovation in healthcare delivery.
