## Active Inference and Psychoanalysis: How Aligned Are the Frameworks?

The intersection between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis has become a new area of interdisciplinary research. This convergence may offer psychoanalytic theory new conceptual tools drawn from computational neuroscience, potentially revitalizing a field that has struggled for institutional legitimacy in recent decades. As we have mentioned in our previous posts the FEP provides a mathematical framework describing how living organisms maintain their structural integrity by minimizing **free energy**, which represents prediction error within a probabilistic model. Active inference, which extends from the FEP, proposes that brains function as active agents that constantly generate predictions about their environment rather than passively processing sensory input. This framework not only models biological and psychological processes but attempts to formalize them in ways that invite comparison with psychoanalytic concepts. However, psychoanalysis operates within an interpretive, hermeneutic tradition rooted in narrative, clinical encounter, and symbolic meaning. Active inference, by contrast, is computational and mechanistic, formulated within Bayesian probabilistic frameworks. The potential value—and the danger—of this dialogue lies in navigating these distinct epistemologies without reducing one to the other.


### Freud's "Project" and the Free Energy Principle

Freud's early *Project for a Scientific Psychology* (1895) represented an ambitious, though ultimately abandoned, attempt to ground psychology in the neurophysiology available at the time. Despite its historical limitations, the *Project* anticipated several ideas that active inference and the FEP now formalize, including concepts of energy flow, psychic conflict, and the nervous system's drive toward equilibrium.  Freud's notion of the mind as a dynamic energy system, influenced by 19th-century thermodynamics, is somehow similar to the FEP's characterization of the brain as a system that minimizes uncertainty. In Freud's model, concepts like *binding* (*Bindung*) and *unbinding* (*Entbindung*) describes how the nervous system processes excitation—which appears to parallel the FEP's distinction between prediction error (unbound energy) and coherent generative models (bound energy). His distinction between primary (id-driven, wish-fulfilling) and secondary (ego-driven, reality-oriented) processes finds potential resonance in the FEP's hierarchical generative models. In active inference, lower hierarchical levels process immediate sensory prediction errors, while higher levels encode abstract, temporally extended representations that shape both perception and action. Both frameworks suggest the mind strives toward a state of minimal excitation or surprise—a kind of homeostatic equilibrium.  However, this analogy is fundamentally metaphorical, that is (as we mentioned in several previoous posts)  FEP offers a formal, information-theoretic framework grounded in variational Bayesian inference, while Freud's psychodynamics rests on speculative neurophysiology and clinical observation. The two operate on fundamentally different epistemological planes, and conflating them risks obscuring rather than clarifying either framework. 

### Dreams: Simulation or Symbol?

Psychoanalysis famously regards dreams as the "royal road to the unconscious," revealing disguised wishes, unresolved conflicts, and repressed material. For Freud, dreams serve not only an expressive function but also a defensive one: they transform unacceptable desires into symbolic narratives through *dream work*—mechanisms such as condensation, displacement, and secondary revision. From an active inference perspective, dreaming may serve a complementary, though distinct, function. During REM sleep, the brain appears to relax sensory constraints and engage in generative modeling, simulating possible scenarios and integrating emotionally significant experiences. This "offline inference" may allow the brain to explore hypothetical states to refine its predictive models and minimize future surprise. Research suggests that REM sleep facilitates pattern extraction from past experiences and enables the consolidation of implicit, emotionally salient memories. This account has some similariy to Freud's idea of dreams as a site of psychological work. Both perspectives put dreaming as a process that metabolizes affect, rehearses responses, and processes emotionally loaded material. Yet the underlying logic is substantially different, Freud emphasizes symbolic transformation and the censorship imposed by psychic defenses, while active inference treats dreams as structurally constrained simulations aimed at optimizing generative models. Both models describe adaptation to internal conflict and emotional intensity, but they explain this adaptation through fundamentally different mechanisms—one prioritizing symbolic interpretation, the other formal simulation.


### Desire and Conflict: Motivational Dynamics

Freud's theory of desire centers on tension between instinctual drives and the regulatory functions of the ego and superego. Repression keeps unacceptable desires unconscious, yet these desires persist, shaping symptoms, dreams, and behaviors. For Freud, conflict constitutes the engine of psychic life, and its resolution remains perpetually incomplete. Active inference provides what might be considered a computational analog to this dynamic. Desire can be modeled as a prior over preferred states—probabilistic expectations about outcomes the agent seeks to attain. These priors influence perception, cognition, and action through policy selection, shaping how the agent engages with the world. As Kruglanski et al. note in their 2020 paper synthesizing epistemic motivation with active inference, "all thinking is wishful thinking" in a predictive brain—prediction is inherently motivated by expected outcomes. Active inference formalizes motivation as precision-weighted prediction over policies, but psychoanalysis treats desire as symbolic, relational, and historically embedded. To link these too concepts directly would risk reductionism where in the computational framework it is possible to model drive and conflict in abstract, formal terms, but it struggles to capture the dense symbolic texture of psychic life—the meanings embedded in dreams, fantasies, and transference relationships.

## Methodological and Epistemological Reflections

Despite these suggestive parallels, serious methodological and epistemological obstacles complicate any integration of psychoanalysis and active inference such as **Different Scientific Paradigms**, psychoanalysis belongs to the hermeneutic tradition, concerned with meaning-making and narrative coherence. Active inference is embedded in formal mechanistic science, concerned with algorithmic explanation and testable prediction. These frameworks operate within what philosophers like Kuhn might call incommensurable paradigms of inquiry. **Conceptual Ambiguity:** Terms like "energy," "conflict," or "desire" carry different connotations in each system. In psychoanalysis, energy is metaphorical and affective; in the FEP, free energy is a precise mathematical quantity derived from information theory. Overextending these analogies risks conceptual confusion rather than clarification. **Empirical Generalizability:** While active inference generates testable predictions in experimental paradigms and psychiatric modeling, psychoanalytic constructs have historically resisted quantification. Clinical data from psychoanalysis is rich and nuanced but not easily formalized within computational frameworks. 
**Critique and Caution:** Critics of psychoanalysis often cite its lack of falsifiability—though this criticism has been challenged as both philosophically flawed and empirically outdated. Critics of the FEP, meanwhile, warn that it risks becoming a "theory of everything" that explains too much while predicting too little. Any integration must avoid collapsing into either naive formalism or interpretive excess. 

## Wrap-up

The dialogue between psychoanalysis and active inference is rich but has conceptual risks. The FEP and active inference offer formal, computational lenses through which to reinterpret some of Freud's most enduring insights: the mind as a system under tension, perpetually negotiating between competing demands to maintain internal coherence and adapt to its environment. However, this interpretive pairing of two frameworks needs epistemological care. Active inference provides elegant formalisms, but these cannot substitute for the narrative, symbolic, and relational dimensions that psychoanalysis brings to understanding human experience. **The analogy between psychic energy and free energy proves fruitful only when treated as metaphor rather than equation.** True integration, if it proves possible at all, lies not in collapsing one framework into the other but in allowing each to illuminate the other's blind spots. Psychoanalysis can challenge active inference to account more adequately for affect, narrative, and transference. Active inference can offer psychoanalysis new tools for modeling conflict, adaptation, and learning. By embracing both the synergies and the tensions, we may develop a richer, more pluralistic understanding of the psyche—one that honors both its symbolic complexity and its computational structure.
