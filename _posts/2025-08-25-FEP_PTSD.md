#### Active Inference Framework Account of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has long lasting effects of individuals exposed to traumatic experiences leading to significant neuropsychological and behavioral challenges. Traditional models often fragment PTSD’s complexity, focusing on isolated dysfunctions. The active inference framework, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides an integrative lens to understand PTSD. By emphasizing predictive coding and maladaptive belief updating, this approach links neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of PTSD. This essay explores how the active inference framework reinterprets PTSD’s core mechanisms, offering a unified perspective on its development, persistence, and impact.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly impacts individuals who have experienced traumatic events, such as combat veterans, first responders, and abuse survivors. Traditional models often focus on specific dysfunctions in neurobiology or behavioral/emotional patterns. However, a more recent approach using the active inference framework aims to unify these perspectives by reinterpreting neuropsychological dysfunctions, by recasting concepts like executive control, attention, and contextual processing in terms of active inference. The active inference framework puts forward tye need for a generative model that explains PTSD through message passing and belief updating. The framework's explanatory approach involves interacting levels including embodied-embedded behavioral dynamics, neurobiological substrates, hierarchical Bayesian models of interactions, and psychophysical/phenomenological observations. For instance, under active inference, reward is seen as minimizing expected free energy, with the "fight or flight" response as a survival strategy involving high cost in terms of organism resources, that balances energy allocation to ensure survival against perceived threats.

This approach views PTSD as a maladaptive stress response from an evolutionary perspective, aligning with broader theories of stress and emotion. It emphasizes self-preservation through active inference, where the organism must allocate metabolic resources to avoid existential danger. This alternative perspective on PTSD by reinterprets traditional concepts of top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory control, and attention within an embodied and environmentally embedded neuronal framework. This new perspective also redefines neurocognitive functions such as reality testing, fear generalization, fear extinction, and safety learning. PTSD may cause individuals to adopt maladaptive priors, favoring "fight or flight" or "freeze" responses over exploratory behaviors. These maladaptive priors hinder the usual reality-testing process, preventing the continuous reassessment of the world and reinforcing pathological responses. Physiologically, this impaired belief updating is seen as a form of sensory attenuation, where the precision of sensory signals is covertly reduced. This conserves metabolic energy by limiting sensory processing to higher cortical areas, leading to weakened effective connectivity due to neurochemical imbalances. The PTSD response prioritizes safety, often resulting in a state of heightened threat preparedness. This physiological state change is characterized by a reluctance to explore and confirm an "all clear" signal, perpetuating a self-maintaining threat state. This perspective aligns with known neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral patterns associated with PTSD, offering predictive and construct validity.

Repeated exposure to stressors can lead to changes in the brain's predictive models, resulting in either habituation or sensitization to stress. PTSD can be understood through two main dysfunctions: a heightened bias for interpreting sensory stimuli as existential threats and a compromised ability to reassess these threats. Individuals with PTSD are more likely to perceive neutral stimuli as threats and maintain this perception even when the threat no longer exists. This results in a prolonged threat-response state, which can explain the hyperarousal and low cortisol levels observed in PTSD patients. The neurobiological basis for these dysfunctions involves abnormal neuromodulation, where the brain's mechanisms for encoding sensory precision and processing prediction errors are impaired. Stress can weaken synaptic efficacy and network connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), leading to a reduced ability to process sensory information accurately. This results in a reliance on strong top-down biases, where the brain defaults to threat responses due to inadequate sensory evidence processing. In PTSD, stress-induced impairments prevent the brain leads to lower information transfer and a stronger attraction to the threat-response state. This state inhibits the neurochemical mechanisms necessary to escape the stress response, resulting in a persistent threat perception. Simulation studies support this model, showing that effective neuronal communication relies on synchronized activity, which is disrupted in PTSD. This disruption leads to imprecise sensory processing and an overreliance on threat priors. The amygdala, which is crucial for processing fear and threat-related stimuli, becomes overactive and inhibits the PFC, further impairing the ability to reassess and mitigate perceived threats.

Another key aspect is the concept of aberrant precision weighting, where individuals with PTSD tend to overestimate the precision of threat-related predictions. This results in persistent and exaggerated fear responses even in safe environments, explaining the characteristic hypervigilance and re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD. One advantage of applying the active inference to PTSD lies in the ability to recontextualize and integrate a range of empirical evidence with a model of how sensory-perceptual and cognitive aspects of anxiety may arise, going beyond static belief/filter models often applied in traditional cognitive-behavioral approaches. Similar to anxiety, traumatic experiences can lead to a heightened state of uncertainty and unpredictability, causing the brain to overestimate the likelihood of future threats. This learned uncertainty perpetuates anxiety and stress responses, contributing to the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Also concerning active inference and the role of action in minimizing free energy can manifest as maladaptive explore-exploit dynamics in PTSD. Individuals may exhibit impaired ability to update their beliefs about environmental safety, leading to either excessive avoidance (over-exploitation of perceived safe behaviors) or risky behaviors (maladaptive exploration) as coping mechanisms. Applying the Free Energy Principle and active inference framework to PTSD offers a novel understanding of its neuropsychological and physiological underpinnings. This approach reinterprets PTSD as a maladaptive predictive model, highlighting disruptions in belief updating, sensory processing, and precision weighting. By integrating neurobiological, behavioral, and psychological dimensions, it provides a unified and predictive model that aligns with empirical evidence. This perspective deepens our understanding of PTSD and paves the way for novel, integrative therapeutic strategies targeting these maladaptive mechanisms.
