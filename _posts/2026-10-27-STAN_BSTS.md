**Time-Varying Trend Volatility in Bayesian Structural Time Series Models**

**Introduction**

In many real-world time series, the variability of the underlying trend itself evolves over time. Economic indicators, for example, may experience stable growth in some periods and high volatility in others due to macroeconomic shocks. Standard BSTS models assume constant volatility in the trend component, which can be overly restrictive and obscure critical temporal dynamics. Time-varying trend volatility offers a flexible solution, enabling models to adapt to changing environments and improving both interpretability and predictive performance. In this post, we extend the canonical BSTS framework by allowing the volatility of the trend to change over time, implement this model in Stan, and illustrate its application in R.

**Model Specification with Stochastic Volatility in the Trend**

The conventional local linear trend model assumes:

$$
\mu_t = \mu_{t-1} + \tau_{t-1} + \eta_t, \quad \eta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\mu^2)
$$

$$
\tau_t = \tau_{t-1} + \zeta_t, \quad \zeta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\tau^2)
$$

To model time-varying volatility in the trend, we introduce a stochastic process for the log-variance of $\zeta_t$:

$$
\log \sigma_{\tau, t}^2 = h_t, \quad h_t = h_{t-1} + \nu_t, \quad \nu_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_h^2)
$$

$$
\zeta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \exp(h_t))
$$

This specification corresponds to a stochastic volatility model applied to the trend innovation process. It allows the trend volatility to evolve over time in a log-random walk, adapting to structural changes in the underlying system.

**Simulating a Time Series with Time-Varying Trend Volatility**

```r
set.seed(123)
n <- 120
m <- 12

level <- numeric(n)
trend <- numeric(n)
h <- numeric(n)
sigma_trend_t <- numeric(n)
season <- numeric(n)
y <- numeric(n)

level[1] <- 10
trend[1] <- 0.5
h[1] <- log(0.05^2)
seasonal_pattern <- sin(2 * pi * (1:m) / m)
season[1:m] <- seasonal_pattern

for (t in 2:n) {
  h[t] <- h[t - 1] + rnorm(1, 0, 0.1)
  sigma_trend_t[t] <- sqrt(exp(h[t]))
  trend[t] <- trend[t - 1] + rnorm(1, 0, sigma_trend_t[t])
  level[t] <- level[t - 1] + trend[t - 1] + rnorm(1, 0, 0.3)
  season[t] <- season[t %% m + 1]
  y[t] <- level[t] + season[t] + rnorm(1, 0, 1)
}

ts.plot(y, main = "Simulated Time Series with Time-Varying Trend Volatility")
```

This simulated series captures both a gradually evolving trend and stochastic fluctuations in trend volatility.

**Stan Model Code for Time-Varying Trend Volatility**

```stan
functions {
  vector seasonal_component(vector s, int N, int m) {
    vector[N] seasonal;
    for (t in 1:N) {
      if (t > m)
        seasonal[t] = s[t - m];
      else
        seasonal[t] = s[t];
    }
    return seasonal;
  }
}

data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  int<lower=1> m;
  vector[N] y;
}

parameters {
  real<lower=0> sigma_obs;
  real<lower=0> sigma_level;
  real<lower=0> sigma_h;

  vector[N] level;
  vector[N] trend;
  vector[N] seasonal;
  vector[N] h; // log variance of trend innovation
}

model {
  // priors
  sigma_obs ~ normal(0, 1);
  sigma_level ~ normal(0, 0.5);
  sigma_h ~ normal(0, 0.2);
  h[1] ~ normal(log(0.05^2), 0.1);

  // seasonal component
  seasonal[(m+1):N] ~ normal(seasonal[1:(N-m)], 0.5);

  // latent processes
  for (t in 2:N) {
    h[t] ~ normal(h[t-1], sigma_h);
    trend[t] ~ normal(trend[t-1], exp(0.5 * h[t]));
    level[t] ~ normal(level[t-1] + trend[t-1], sigma_level);
  }

  y ~ normal(level + seasonal_component(seasonal, N, m), sigma_obs);
}
```

This model captures the stochastic evolution of trend volatility via a latent log-variance process $h_t$. It is particularly useful for detecting shifts in the smoothness or roughness of the trend over time.

**Fitting the Model in R with RStan**

```r
stan_model_bsts <- "..."  # insert the Stan code above as a string

library(rstan)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)

data_list <- list(N = length(y), m = m, y = y)

fit <- stan(model_code = stan_model_bsts, data = data_list,
            chains = 4, iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, seed = 123)

print(fit, pars = c("sigma_obs", "sigma_level", "sigma_h"))
```

The posterior for `sigma_h` indicates how much the log-volatility of the trend is allowed to vary. High values suggest more abrupt changes in volatility, while smaller values imply smoother variation.

**Visualizing Time-Varying Volatility and Trend**

```r
post <- extract(fit)

h_mean <- apply(post$h, 2, mean)
trend_mean <- apply(post$trend, 2, mean)

df <- data.frame(
  time = 1:n,
  log_vol = h_mean,
  trend = trend_mean
)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = log_vol), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Posterior Mean of Log Trend Volatility", y = "log(σ²_τ)", x = "Time") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(df, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend), color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Posterior Mean Trend", y = "Trend", x = "Time") +
  theme_minimal()
```

These plots reveal how the uncertainty in the trend evolves over time, helping analysts pinpoint periods of instability or transition.

**Applications and Extensions**

Time-varying trend volatility is valuable in domains where regime shifts or changing uncertainty are common. For example, in financial time series, economic forecasting, and climate dynamics, allowing for heteroscedastic innovations provides more realistic and responsive models. The stochastic volatility component can be further extended to the level or seasonal terms, or combined with covariates in a full dynamic regression framework. Hierarchical structures or multivariate time series models can also be built by layering this volatility structure over shared latent components.

**Conclusion**

Incorporating time-varying trend volatility into BSTS models enhances their flexibility and relevance for nonstationary time series. The approach enables capturing shifts in the smoothness of the trend component, offering improved interpretability and predictive accuracy in turbulent systems. With Stan’s modeling language and RStan’s interface, practitioners can easily implement and explore such models, adapting them to a wide array of practical forecasting and inference problems.
