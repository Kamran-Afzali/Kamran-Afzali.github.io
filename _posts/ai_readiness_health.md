#### AI maturity models (AIMMs)

AI maturity models (AIMMs) play a crucial role in assessing an organization's readiness and progress in adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, the definitions and components of AIMMs vary across studies, indicating a lack of consensus in the field. The chosen studies highlight different characteristics and components of AIMMs.

Wendler (2018) developed an AIMM for the marketing domain, featuring four levels of maturity ranging from non-algorithmic enterprise to automated enterprise. The model focused on dimensions like strategy, data, analytics, people/Orga, and decisions. Kreutzer & Sirrenberg (2020) proposed an AIMM that evaluated AI basics and AI fields of application separately, using percentage values. Saari, Kuusisto & Pirttikangas (2019) introduced a web tool with dimensions like strategy and management, products and services, competencies and cooperation, processes, data, and technology. Coates & Martin (2019) designed an AIMM to assess AI bias control with constructs including business, people, user, data, algorithm, and compliance.

Other studies included Abele & D'Onofrio's (2020) AIMM for intelligence system assessment, Tu, Lin & Lee's (2019) metadata-driven automation maturity model, Bangalore Seetharam's (2020) digital AI maturity ladder for retail organizations, Lichtenthaler's (2020) conceptual framework for managing AI in companies, Jaaksi, Koskinen & Jalava's (2018) model for assessing AI adoption maturity, Lee's (2020) assessment method for Industrial AI, Yablonsky's (2019) multi-dimensional data-driven AI enterprise innovation maturity framework, Burgess's (2018) AI maturity matrix and heat map, Ellefsen et al.'s (2019) AIMM framework for logistics companies, Seger, Miailhe & Mueller's (2019) AIMM for Intergovernmental Organizations, and Alsheibani, Cheung & Messom's (2019) conceptual model for AIMM evaluation.

The studies reveal variations in the number of levels, descriptors, and elements used in AIMMs. Some studies lack clarity in how dimensions are evaluated, while others focus on specific industries or domains. The different designations used for elements indicate a lack of standard terminology in the field. However, dimensions are often considered the core of AIMMs, representing the maturity levels.

In conclusion, AIMMs offer valuable frameworks for assessing AI readiness and maturity in organizations. While there is no unified definition or standard components, AIMMs provide insights into an organization's progress in adopting AI technologies. Future research should aim to establish a common understanding and standardize the terminology and components of AIMMs to facilitate better evaluation and comparison across organizations.
