### Introduction

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up new avenues for addressing healthcare-related challenges. However, recent AI systems have not fully achieved their intended practical applications. Frequently, AI systems are developed with a predominant focus on technical aspects, neglecting considerations regarding their real-world integration and value. Additionally, applying machine learning to biased or poor-quality datasets can pose significant challenges. Ethical considerations play a critical role in technology-supported clinical decisions, yet these are often inadequately addressed in purely technical evaluations. Integrating AI systems into clinical settings may come with considerable costs and disruptions, necessitating a thorough justification for their deployment. As a result, the generalizability of AI systems and their successful adoption in healthcare may encounter obstacles. Consequently, a rigorous evaluation framework that assesses AI systems at different stages of their clinical deployment is essential. The growing potential of AI in healthcare necessitates a careful evaluation process that encompasses both technical and practical considerations at various stages of AI system deployment. Presently available frameworks tend to focus on specific aspects and might not be adequate for a comprehensive assessment. Developing a unified evaluation framework that addresses the functional, utility, and ethical dimensions of AI models is critical for fostering successful integration and adoption in healthcare settings.

#### OBVIA

This fact sheet presents the main promises (or potential benefits or use cases) of AI in healthcare from the point of view of universal healthcare, the one that aims to improve the health of the population as well as the experience of patients and caregivers. These potential benefits are presented for the most promising uses of artificial intelligence systems (AIS), with a focus on recent developments in AI techniques (e.g. machine learning). This fact sheet does not cover the full potential of AIS to improve health, particularly in support of research, discovery and public health (e.g. prevention and protection). Before presenting the various promises, it is important to emphasize that AIS are not inter- ventions that are easy to circumscribe and evaluate. 

In other words, defining the effectiveness of an AIS is a complicated process, due to the very nature of this type of technology. Firstly, it is sometimes difficult to establish whether a digital tool includes an AIS. The term "AI-mobilized tools" will be used to refer to digital tools that might include one or more AIS. Secondly, the development of AIS based on recent machine learning techniques is special in that it requires so-called real-life data (or routine data, i.e. taken from the daily activities of clinicians or patients) in order to learn. These data are therefore necessarily local, and difficult to transpose from one context to another. This means that we need to put in place safeguards to ensure that an AIS that has been developed in another context still performs as well when implemented locally. It should be noted, however, that the technical performance of an AIS should not be confused with the effectiveness of an AI-enabled tool, once deployed and used on a daily basis. In fact, digital tools can be used in a multitude of ways by targeted users, and can be integrated differently into the way they work. This means that the sequence between the deployment of a digital tool mobilizing AI in a given context, and the benefits (all the advantages linked to this use of the tool, whether direct or indirect) that could be linked to it, is far from easy to trace. It is therefore important to clearly define how to judge the quality of a tool mobilizing AI in healthcare, firstly in its technical components (AIS performance), but also in its uses (used by whom, when, how?). For example, a tool that is deployed but not used to its full potential, by all its intended users (e.g., all clinicians, all patients, etc.), will find it difficult to realize the promised benefits.

The promises of tools mobilizing AI in healthcare must therefore be approached with caution. They rely both on a quality tool (which has the potential to deliver on the promises), which is also aligned with the local context (which can fit into practices, be adopted and used routinely, to enable the promises to be realized). This is why attention must be focused not only on the tool itself, but also on the behaviors (usage practices) associated with it. Finally, it's also important to remember that the development and use of AI-enabled tools can generate negative or harmful consequences, as well as risks for direct users, or more generally for an organization or society as a whole. 

Overall, the most mature tools are those associated with sensor-based data (e.g. radiography, photography). However, several parameters still limit the performance of these tools, as inputs are influenced by the characteristics of the device used to capture the image and/or signal, as well as practices leading to image annotation (which establishes the ground truth or gold standard) for model training and validation. Other types of data (e.g. clinical signs, symptoms, laboratory data, socio-demographics) are more difficult to use to train an AI model, since they are more heterogeneous and less standardized. Similarly, clinical documentation practices (e.g. coding, free-text clinical notes) will influence the type and quality of data available in a computerized clinical record. These factors must be taken into account in the local validation of an AIS that has been developed with data from another environment. This is why, when evaluating an AIS, it is important to focus not only on performance at the design stage, but also on performance during deployment, where practices, devices and related information systems may differ. This requires a high degree of transparency, which is far from the norm, even in the scientific literature.

Digital tools for use cases requiring heterogeneous clinical data as input are therefore less mature. To ensure that AIS mobilizing heterogeneous clinical data as input are effective and safe (and therefore unbiased), it is important to pay particular attention to the nature and types of input, including local information system data models, local data coding standards, as well as local data capture and quality analysis practices prior to their use for secondary use (develop an AI model). For example, complicated clinical conditions, with a diversity of symptoms or high variability of manifestations between individuals, become difficult to represent numerically in a uniform and unambiguous way.
