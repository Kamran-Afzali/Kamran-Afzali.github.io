# The Network Constellation of Personality and Substance Use
Our recently published study entitled “The Network Constellation of Personality and Substance Use: Evolution from Early to Late Adolescence” (Afzali et al., 2020) used graph theory techniques to demonstrate the evolution of the network constellation of personality and cannabis/alcohol use from early to late adolescence. There is a well‐established link between substance use and four personality traits of anxiety–sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, and sensation‐seeking. However, In this study we highlighted that macro/construct‐level models of personality may conceal micro/indicator‐level personality–outcome associations. Our study is praised in the European Journal of Personality editorial indicating “not only it provides a more complex evaluation of the relations between personality and outcomes but also provide more targeted item generation for future measures (e.g.,including more specific items measuring sensation-seeking personality indicators in substance use)”.
