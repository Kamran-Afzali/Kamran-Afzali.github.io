## Selected Universities

### Canada

####  Medical schools 

- There is a need to educate family medicine residents in the realm of health informatics, applied data analytics for continuous quality improvement, and general principles of digital health technologies. However, the integration of health informatics concepts into the curricula of Canadian medical schools and residencies is proceeding slowly (see [here](https://www.cfp.ca/content/65/10/683)). There are offeres by medical associations to improve digital health training in medical schools, for instance [OMD](https://www.ontariomd.ca/documents/resource%20library/dig.%20health%20education%20for%20med%20school.pdf) proposes a Digital Health Curriculum that medical schools can leverage to deliver further value to your students. This digital health educational package includes well-defined instructional digital health materials developed by practicing physicians and digital health experts who are university faculty members. Each module in the curriculum is specifically designed to enhance experiential learning and can be easily customized to the learning goals of each university’s medical school and the student’s education year.

- In recent investigations among UK healthcare professionals (HCPs), notable discrepancies in digital literacy within the healthcare field have been identified. These disparities present obstacles to the efficient integration of emerging technologies in clinical practices. Moreover, insufficient training on the ethical considerations related to these technologies poses a potential dilemma for HCPs in safeguarding patient rights. Recognizing these challenges and the evident need for focused education in digital health, a group pf UK medical doctors have recently [advocate for a concentrated effort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8966807/) on the fundamental component of any healthcare profession—the undergraduate curriculum.

  - The digital transformation has also given rise to an increasing number of cyberattacks, necessitating a reevaluation of cybersecurity practices within a more stringent regulatory framework. Organizations are compelled to adapt to safeguard users, activities, and assets from evolving cyber threats. Additionally, the professionalization of cybercrime exacerbates risks and threats, revealing a significant gap in the protection levels afforded to companies and institutions. The proliferation of non-targeted cyberattacks, such as ransomware and internet fraud employing social engineering techniques, underscores the vulnerabilities of current security measures. The loss of sensitive data due to embezzlement, risks associated with outsourcing applications and data (cloud computing), and the growing adoption of telemedicine over vulnerable communication networks further compound the challenges. In response to these complexities, the two-year Cybersecurity and e-Health Master's program aims to train experts specializing in the cybersecurity of systems, networks, and data within the realms of connected health (e-Health) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These experts will possess the skills to conduct consulting, analysis, and security audits while developing, implementing, and validating technical security solutions.

  - Connected healthcare, in its broadest sense (telemedicine, connected objects, remote monitoring and e-coaching applications, etc.), offers solutions that are potentially useful, if not indispensable, for tomorrow's optimal medical care. Hardly a day goes by without a patient telling us about a connected application or object. Connected health is not taught in medical school. However, many professionals from other backgrounds are keen to acquire knowledge and skills in connected health, to help them bring their projects to fruition. The DU offers a cross-disciplinary introduction to connected healthcare for all those who understand the imminent digital shift in medicine. This course is aimed  for Healthcare professionals, administrative staff, start-ups, IT specialists and investors who want to acquire the knowledge and skills they need to successfully implement connected healthcare projects.
