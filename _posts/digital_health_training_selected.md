## Selected Universities

### Canada

####  Medical schools 

- There is a need to educate family medicine residents in the realm of health informatics, applied data analytics for continuous quality improvement, and general principles of digital health technologies. However, the integration of health informatics concepts into the curricula of Canadian medical schools and residencies is proceeding slowly (see [here](https://www.cfp.ca/content/65/10/683)). There are offeres by medical associations to improve digital health training in medical schools, for instance [OMD](https://www.ontariomd.ca/documents/resource%20library/dig.%20health%20education%20for%20med%20school.pdf) proposes a Digital Health Curriculum that medical schools can leverage to deliver further value to your students. This digital health educational package includes well-defined instructional digital health materials developed by practicing physicians and digital health experts who are university faculty members. Each module in the curriculum is specifically designed to enhance experiential learning and can be easily customized to the learning goals of each university’s medical school and the student’s education year.  

#### University of Victoria  (Health Information Science/Nursing)
- [Master of health informatics- Double Degree Master of Nursing and Master of Science in Health Informatics](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/graduate/masters/index.php)
  
   - Our double-degree option lets you study nursing and health informatics side by side. You'll become a nursing leader in this rapidly expanding field. You’ll study areas of health technology like telehealth and electronic health care records.
   - This program requires a completion of a total of 31.5 units of study, including a research project or thesis. All course requirements must be completed prior to proceeding to the final oral examination. Students will have a supervisor from each School. Students with an overall A- average may complete a thesis, with the approval of both supervisors, the Director of the School of Health Information Science and the Associate Director, Graduate Education in the School of Nursing. Completion of a Master's degree with thesis is encouraged for students intending to pursue Doctoral studies. Students are expected to be enrolled full time for the duration of their program. Cooperative learning experiences must usually be undertaken outside of a student's current employment setting.

- [Health Informatics (MSc)](https://www.uvic.ca/graduate/programs/graduate-programs/credential-pages/health-information-science-cred/health-informatics-msc.php#ipn-faculties-amp-departments)
  
   - Health information science (also known as health informatics) is the study of: how health data are collected, stored and communicated; how those data are processed into health information suitable for administrative and clinical decision making; and how computer and telecommunications technology can be applied to support these processes. You will learn to identify what information and data are needed and used to make effective healthcare decision by doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, government planners and other health care professionals.
   - The MSc program requires completion of coursework and a research project. All course requirements must be completed prior to proceeding to the final oral examination. Exceptional students with supervisor and Director approval may work on a thesis rather than a research project. Students are expected to be enrolled full time continuously during their program.

  - The digital transformation has also given rise to an increasing number of cyberattacks, necessitating a reevaluation of cybersecurity practices within a more stringent regulatory framework. Organizations are compelled to adapt to safeguard users, activities, and assets from evolving cyber threats. Additionally, the professionalization of cybercrime exacerbates risks and threats, revealing a significant gap in the protection levels afforded to companies and institutions. The proliferation of non-targeted cyberattacks, such as ransomware and internet fraud employing social engineering techniques, underscores the vulnerabilities of current security measures. The loss of sensitive data due to embezzlement, risks associated with outsourcing applications and data (cloud computing), and the growing adoption of telemedicine over vulnerable communication networks further compound the challenges. In response to these complexities, the two-year Cybersecurity and e-Health Master's program aims to train experts specializing in the cybersecurity of systems, networks, and data within the realms of connected health (e-Health) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These experts will possess the skills to conduct consulting, analysis, and security audits while developing, implementing, and validating technical security solutions.

  - Connected healthcare, in its broadest sense (telemedicine, connected objects, remote monitoring and e-coaching applications, etc.), offers solutions that are potentially useful, if not indispensable, for tomorrow's optimal medical care. Hardly a day goes by without a patient telling us about a connected application or object. Connected health is not taught in medical school. However, many professionals from other backgrounds are keen to acquire knowledge and skills in connected health, to help them bring their projects to fruition. The DU offers a cross-disciplinary introduction to connected healthcare for all those who understand the imminent digital shift in medicine. This course is aimed  for Healthcare professionals, administrative staff, start-ups, IT specialists and investors who want to acquire the knowledge and skills they need to successfully implement connected healthcare projects.
