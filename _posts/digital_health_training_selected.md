### France 

At the start of the 2024 academic year, digital health will make its appearance on the curriculum of the first cycle of health studies, as well as in university paramedical training courses. This is a logical next step, as medical faculties and UFRs began teaching digital health to students in their second cycle (4th to 6th year) in 2019. It was necessary to move fast and train doctors close to their entry into the job market. Have faculties taken too long to grasp the subject in its entirety? In 2016, Pierre Simon, a nephrologist and founding president of the Société française de télémédecine, urged universities to speed up the teaching of e-health.

  - The digital transformation has also given rise to an increasing number of cyberattacks, necessitating a reevaluation of cybersecurity practices within a more stringent regulatory framework. Organizations are compelled to adapt to safeguard users, activities, and assets from evolving cyber threats. Additionally, the professionalization of cybercrime exacerbates risks and threats, revealing a significant gap in the protection levels afforded to companies and institutions. The proliferation of non-targeted cyberattacks, such as ransomware and internet fraud employing social engineering techniques, underscores the vulnerabilities of current security measures. The loss of sensitive data due to embezzlement, risks associated with outsourcing applications and data (cloud computing), and the growing adoption of telemedicine over vulnerable communication networks further compound the challenges. In response to these complexities, the two-year Cybersecurity and e-Health Master's program aims to train experts specializing in the cybersecurity of systems, networks, and data within the realms of connected health (e-Health) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These experts will possess the skills to conduct consulting, analysis, and security audits while developing, implementing, and validating technical security solutions.
