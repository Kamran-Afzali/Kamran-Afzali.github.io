#### University of Victoria  (Health Information Science/Nursing)
- [Master of health informatics- Double Degree Master of Nursing and Master of Science in Health Informatics](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/graduate/masters/index.php)
  
   - Our double-degree option lets you study nursing and health informatics side by side. You'll become a nursing leader in this rapidly expanding field. You’ll study areas of health technology like telehealth and electronic health care records.
   - This program requires a completion of a total of 31.5 units of study, including a research project or thesis. All course requirements must be completed prior to proceeding to the final oral examination. Students will have a supervisor from each School. Students with an overall A- average may complete a thesis, with the approval of both supervisors, the Director of the School of Health Information Science and the Associate Director, Graduate Education in the School of Nursing. Completion of a Master's degree with thesis is encouraged for students intending to pursue Doctoral studies. Students are expected to be enrolled full time for the duration of their program. Cooperative learning experiences must usually be undertaken outside of a student's current employment setting.

- [Health Informatics (MSc)](https://www.uvic.ca/graduate/programs/graduate-programs/credential-pages/health-information-science-cred/health-informatics-msc.php#ipn-faculties-amp-departments)
  
   - Health information science (also known as health informatics) is the study of: how health data are collected, stored and communicated; how those data are processed into health information suitable for administrative and clinical decision making; and how computer and telecommunications technology can be applied to support these processes. You will learn to identify what information and data are needed and used to make effective healthcare decision by doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, government planners and other health care professionals.
   - The MSc program requires completion of coursework and a research project. All course requirements must be completed prior to proceeding to the final oral examination. Exceptional students with supervisor and Director approval may work on a thesis rather than a research project. Students are expected to be enrolled full time continuously during their program.

   - [BSc in Health Information Science](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/undergraduate/programs/bsc/index.php)
   - Health Information Science is about connecting the worlds of technology and health care. To span these worlds, you'll need expertise in both fields. We offer a four-year co-operative education program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Health Information Science which gives you expertise in both healthcare and information technology. 
   - [Combined Major in Computer Science and Health Information Science](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/undergraduate/programs/combined-major/index.php)
   - The Combined Major in Computer Science and Health Information Science combines studies in the organization of health care systems and specific issues involving health informatics with the fundamentals of software engineering, operating systems, programming languages and computer hardware.
- [Graduate Certificate in Health Terminology Standards](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/graduate/certificate/index.php)
   - The Graduate Certificate in Health Terminology Standards is a 1-year, part-time program with four graduate level courses done through weekly online evening classes and a virtual workshop. If you work in the health industry and are involved with or have an interest in health terminologies and standards, interoperable electronic health record, and clinical coding and classification, then this Certificate is for you. The program is intended to meet national and international needs for best practices in controlled terminologies used in the health industry. Graduates of this program are eligible for the **Canadian College of Health Information Management Terminology Standards Specialist Certification**.

#### McMaster (collaboration by three prestigious McMaster Faculties and Schools – the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering, and the DeGroote School of Business)
  
- [Master eHealth](https://ehealth.mcmaster.ca/)
   - McMaster’s eHealth MSc program is a unique healthcare graduate program that immerses you in the world of digital health informatics. Offered through a collaboration by three prestigious McMaster Faculties and Schools – the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering, and the DeGroote School of Business – the eHealth MSc builds on theoretical foundations in healthcare, information technology and business. An 8-month internship offers firsthand perspective on how these fields intersect in the transformation of modern healthcare delivery and management. You do not need an information technology degree to enroll in the eHealth MSc. Our interdisciplinary approach to learning lets you identify your area of study and pursue this through elective coursework and research. The program’s flexibility means that your academic experience can be as broad or as focused as you like. Modes of study include full time course-based, full time thesis-based, and part-time options.
   - Complete at least 5 graduate-level, one-term courses. You must earn at least a B- in each of them. This includes: 4 compulsory (required) courses. At least one approved elective from your area of focus. Complete an 8-month internship. Prepare and orally defend a written thesis.
