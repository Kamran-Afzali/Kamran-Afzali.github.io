## Active inference and psychoanalysis how aligned are the frameworks?


The relationship between the Free Energy Principle (FEP), active inference, and psychoanalysis represents an ongoing area of interdisciplinary exploration, offering a potential framework for integrating the insights of psychoanalytic theory and computational neuroscience. This convergence has the potential to bring a new perspective to psychoanalytic psychotherapies, which have, in recent decades, been marginalized by other therapeutic approaches. At its core, the FEP, proposed by Karl Friston, provides a mathematical model of how living organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing **free energy**, a measure of disorder and surprise. Active inference, a corollary of the FEP, puts that the brain is not a passive recipient of sensory input but an active agent that seeks to predict and control its environment. This framework is not just a theoretical construct, but also a way of understanding the biological and psychological processes that underpin human behavior.

#### Freud's "Project"

Freud's early "Project for a Scientific Psychology," written in 1895, represents an, ultimately abandoned, attempt to ground psychological theory in the neurophysiology of his time. Despite its limitations, this work anticipates many concepts now formalized within the frameworks of active inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). While Freud’s "Project" was limited by the available science of his era, its core ideas about energy flow, psychic conflict, and the brain’s drive to maintain a stable state resonate with the principles of active inference and the FEP, suggesting an alignment between early psychoanalytic thought and contemporary neuroscience. The FEP can be seen as a formalization and extension of Freud's early ideas, providing a neuroscientific framework for understanding the mechanisms of the mind.

**Freud viewed living things as dynamic energy systems, an idea deeply rooted in the physiology and thermodynamics of his time**. This perspective aligns with the FEP, which posits that all biological systems, including the brain, minimize free energy. According to the FEP, the brain functions as an open, adaptive, and complex system that is constantly attempting to reduce its free energy to resist a natural tendency towards disorder. The FEP describes the function of the mind-brain system as an adaptive biological system.

In the "Project," Freud introduced the concepts of "Bindung" (binding) and "Entbindung" (unbinding) to describe how energy is processed in the nervous system. He proposed that the nervous system's primary function was to discharge activation, but this was modified by an opposing secondary principle that delayed and modified the discharge. This concept is mirrored in the FEP, where the brain is viewed as an engine of prediction that seeks to minimize surprise and uncertainty by converting free energy into bound energy. Unbound energy, in this context, can be understood as a signal of prediction error, while bound energy is a representation that minimizes prediction error by fitting with the world.






Freud's distinction between primary and secondary processes also finds an interesting parallel within the FEP. Primary processes, associated with the id, are characterized by a free flow of energy and hallucinatory wish fulfillment. Secondary processes, linked to the ego, involve bound energy, language, and logic. This dual-process model is similar to the FEP's hierarchical model, in which lower levels of processing are more associated with prediction errors, while higher levels are associated with more stable and complex representations. In the FEP framework, lower levels of processing represent predictions about the external world, while higher levels represent predictions about our own internal states, or self-models.

**Freud also articulated that the purpose of the mental apparatus is to maintain a state of minimal excitation, which is consistent with the FEP, which suggests the brain’s objective is to minimize free energy and prediction error**. The FEP proposes that living systems act to minimize surprise, which is consistent with the notion that organisms try to maintain states within physiological bounds. The brain continuously adjusts its models of the world to minimize surprise by reducing prediction errors, therefore free energy is reduced as the brain's models are improved. **One of the most compelling aspects of the FEP is its potential to formalize and quantify concepts that Freud struggled with, such as psychic energy and conflict**. While Freud’s attempt to quantify conflict in terms of psychic energy encountered challenges, the FEP offers a way to quantify conflict as the free energy of competing policies. In this context, conflict arises when there is no clear winner amongst competing actions, and beliefs about what action to take have a low precision. Free energy is an information theoretic concept, not a physical energy, and can be mathematically analyzed to account for the dynamics of mental processes.

Freud’s "Project" was an attempt to ground psychology in the natural sciences, specifically in the physiology of the brain. Although he had to abandon this endeavor due to the limitations of his time, the FEP, with its basis in neurophysiology and information theory, aligns with Freud’s original vision of understanding the mind as a function of the brain. Freud's notion of "contact-barriers" in the "Project," which served as mechanisms for memory, bear a striking resemblance to the modern concept of synapses, which are the contact points between neurons. The alignment between Freud's "Project" and active inference/FEP is remarkable. While Freud's work was constrained by the scientific limitations of the 19th century, his core intuitions about the dynamic and energetic nature of the mind, its drive for stability, and the mechanisms of conflict and defense are echoed in the contemporary neuroscientific framework provided by active inference and the FEP. The FEP can be understood as a formal and quantifiable extension of Freud's early ideas, giving new life to some of his most challenging and enduring concepts.


### Dreams

The alignment between active inference, the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and the psychoanalytic understanding of dreams reveals how dreams can be seen as a fundamental process for minimizing surprise and shaping our understanding of the world. Psychoanalysis considers dreams as a crucial pathway to the unconscious, and the FEP offers a complementary perspective by suggesting that dreams serve to refine our generative models and reduce free energy.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, **dreams are the "royal road to the unconscious"**, offering a glimpse into our hidden desires and traumatic experiences. Freud proposed that during sleep, the psychic energy is freer, leading to the expression of desires in a hallucinatory manner. The FEP echoes this by suggesting that dreams represent a state where the usual constraints on our generative models are relaxed, allowing for the exploration of different scenarios and the integration of new information.

The FEP suggests that **the brain is continuously attempting to minimize its free energy, which can be achieved by either changing the world or updating its internal models**. Dreams, in this context, can be understood as a form of "virtual reality" where the brain simulates possible future scenarios to prepare for potential challenges and reduce prediction error. By playing out these scenarios, the brain can refine its predictive models and reduce the likelihood of being surprised by future events. 

Likewise, **dreaming elaborates trauma so that it becomes thinkable**. This process involves a state of "letting go", which allows the emergence of simple and elegant solutions. **Psychoanalytical therapies catalyze these meaning and narrative processes, helping to regulate the psyche's energetic dynamics**. The psychoanalytic approach considers that dreams express unconscious desires and traumatic experiences. The therapist pays attention to the patient's dreams and proposes interpretations about their meaning. **Dreams create a "virtual reality space" that allows for exploration of desires and traumatic experiences that have not been integrated**.



The concept of dreams in psychoanalysis has long been a subject of intrigue, offering a window into the unconscious mind and the hidden mechanisms that govern thoughts and behaviors. Freud’s work in the early 20th century established dreams as a form of psychological processing, a manifestation of repressed desires, unresolved conflicts, and a method for the psyche to cope with unconscious material. At the same time, the concept of active inference, rooted in modern neuroscience, provides a computational framework for understanding how the brain predicts, processes, and adapts to sensory inputs. The free-energy principle, a core idea within active inference, proposes that the brain strives to minimize surprise by updating predictions based on sensory feedback. This theory has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding cognition, perception, and even complex behaviors like emotion regulation and memory suppression. When examined through the lens of active inference, psychoanalytic concepts like dreams may reveal a deeper connection between unconscious processing, the regulation of internal conflicts, and the brain's adaptive strategies for maintaining homeostasis. This error-minimizing approach is akin to the brain’s need to resolve conflict or anxiety, often represented symbolically in dreams. Dreaming can be viewed as a type of prediction process wherein the brain attempts to integrate unconscious material into a coherent, albeit sometimes distorted, narrative. This aligns closely with Freud’s idea of dreams as a form of "wish fulfillment," where unconscious desires are played out in symbolic forms. The brain’s drive to resolve contradictions, represented as internal conflicts, may be a key motivator for the creation of dreams, as the mind seeks to integrate these conflicts into a less threatening form, thus reducing the surprise or cognitive dissonance associated with unresolved thoughts.

From a neurobiological standpoint, the suppression of unwanted memories or thoughts is a form of active inference that involves the brain’s attempts to reduce prediction error by blocking or reinterpreting sensory inputs that conflict with existing models of the world. Research has shown that certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, are involved in controlling the inhibition of unwanted thoughts or memories, a process that is vital to the regulation of emotional responses and the management of internal conflicts. This is where the intersection between defense mechanisms, like repression, and active inference becomes apparent. As active inference models suggest, the brain constantly attempts to adjust its predictions based on new data. When these predictions are challenged by emotionally overwhelming stimuli or unconscious conflicts, defense mechanisms like repression or dissociation come into play. Dreams, in this framework, might serve as an adaptive mechanism for resolving these conflicts by processing them in a controlled, albeit indirect, manner. In other words, the brain uses dreams to simulate potential solutions to emotional conflicts in a way that minimizes the emotional "cost" of confrontation with painful or repressed memories.


Research on neural systems that underlie memory suppression and conflict resolution provides further evidence of the relationship between dreams and active inference. Studies have demonstrated that the brain engages in inhibitory control to suppress intrusive memories, a process that can be viewed as an attempt to minimize the "free energy" associated with distressing or unresolved thoughts. In psychoanalytic terms, the dynamic between repression and defense mechanisms can be understood as an adaptive function of the mind’s effort to regulate emotional conflict. The suppression of unwanted thoughts is particularly relevant in the context of traumatic memories or unresolved conflicts, which may be symbolically reprocessed in dreams. Just as the brain actively works to suppress certain memories, dreams may serve as a space for the brain to "revisit" these suppressed thoughts in a way that resolves emotional conflict without overwhelming the conscious mind.

In psychoanalysis, the concept of "dream work" refers to the process by which repressed material is transformed and expressed in disguised, symbolic forms. This transformation can be seen as the brain’s method of reducing the intensity of emotional conflicts while still allowing the unconscious material to surface in a manageable form. Active inference models, particularly those incorporating hierarchical predictive coding, provide a compelling explanation for this process. In hierarchical predictive coding, higher-level cognitive structures generate predictions about the world, while lower-level structures provide sensory feedback that either confirms or contradicts these predictions. In the context of dreams, the brain could be seen as creating a simulated environment where unresolved conflicts or desires are represented symbolically. This simulation helps to reduce the uncertainty (or free energy) associated with confronting unconscious material directly, allowing the brain to "test" different scenarios and potential outcomes in a low-risk environment. By doing so, the brain can reconcile the need for emotional regulation with the imperative to resolve internal conflicts, providing a space for adaptive psychological processes.

Just as the brain uses active inference to reconcile discrepancies between predictions and sensory inputs, dreams could be seen as a tool for processing the emotional and cognitive "discrepancies" created by internal conflict, ultimately facilitating the resolution of these tensions without conscious awareness. By viewing dreams through the lens of active inference and the free-energy principle, it becomes clear that dreams serve as a dynamic, adaptive mechanism for reducing psychological conflict and minimizing emotional surprise. The brain’s efforts to update its internal models and reduce prediction error provide a neurobiological basis for understanding the symbolic transformation of unconscious material in dreams. Ultimately, the intersection of these two frameworks reveals the ways in which the brain uses dreams to manage conflict, regulate emotions, and maintain cognitive stability, highlighting the complex and sophisticated nature of the mind’s mechanisms for psychological homeostasis.

### Desire
The alignment between active inference, the Free Energy Principle, and the concept of desire in psychoanalysis creates a framework for understanding motivation, affect, and the interactions between internal states and external actions. Along these lines, **desire (similar and potentially related to free enery) is an active force, shaping perception, cognition, and behavior**, not a passive feeling. Psychoanalysis understands the mind as a system influenced by unconscious desires and conflicts. Freud's work explored psychic energy and how mental processes reduce tension and seek pleasure. The FEP provides a lens to revisit these concepts with a quantifiable, information-theoretic approach to psychic energy. Active inference, based on the FEP, suggests that organisms reduce free energy by inferring the causes of sensations. This minimization involves: **Action:** Changing the external world to match internal expectations, **Perception:** Updating internal models to better predict sensory input.

Desire drives both action and perception, guiding the organism toward predictable states.

The FEP integrates subcortical emotions with cortical predictive models. The mind maintains homeostasis, and predictions are motivated by desires and wishes, supporting the idea that "all thinking is wishful-thinking".

Within active inference, **desire links to action and exploration**. Active inference is enhanced by seeking help and collaboration, a process where individuals refine their understanding of the world. Blocked explorations to reduce free energy may be responsible for psychological illness. Psychoanalysis evokes and then quiets trauma-related unbound energy through free association, dream analysis, and transference analysis.

One way to view **desire is through a linguistic model, where individuals are signifiers in a chain of meaning**. Desire drives individuals to seek the signified object, creating an interplay between subjects. Complexity theory suggests this is a process of partial synchronization where individuals influence internal states.

Affect is key in active inference, serving as an intrinsic motivator. **Free energy is aversive, like mental pain, while reducing it is rewarding**, so positive and negative affects drive the organism to minimize free energy, shaping behavior.

**Expected free energy** formally describes action selection, where the likelihood of choosing an action decreases with the expected free energy. An organism experiencing thirst seeks water because that action is predicted to result in the lowest expected free energy, aligning with the psychoanalytic idea that gratifying an instinct reduces free energy.

Some researchers note the role of **"first priors,"** prioritized predictions related to the body's internal states and the organism's lifestyle. These underpin habits, skills, and social/cultural norms, shaping sense-making.

Motivation and desire are the divergence between an individual's current state and their anticipated future state achieved through action. Expected prediction errors, which quantify the difference between expected and preferred outcomes, drive individuals to reduce this divergence.

**The environment is experienced through desire, presenting "inviting affordances."** Desire drives improving one's "grip" on these affordances, guiding action and shaping interaction with the world.

Freud’s theory of desire revolves around the tension between instinctual drives and the regulatory mechanisms of the psyche, primarily expressed through the id, ego, and superego. The id is the reservoir of instinctual energy, constantly pushing for immediate gratification, while the ego and superego function as regulatory structures that manage these impulses in accordance with reality and moral considerations. In this context, repression serves as a key defense mechanism that keeps unacceptable desires from reaching conscious awareness. However, these desires persist, manifesting in symptoms, dreams, and other unconscious formations. The notion of repression aligns closely with the predictive processing perspective of active inference, wherein the brain suppresses or modifies certain predictions to maintain cognitive stability (Anderson & Hanslmayr, 2014).

From an active inference perspective, desire can be understood as a form of expected free energy minimization. Free energy, in this context, refers to the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory input. In this framework, the mind constructs generative models that anticipate future states, actively shaping perception and behavior. When an individual experiences a desire, it reflects a prediction of a future state that minimizes uncertainty or distress. The fulfillment of a desire is thus an attempt to resolve this predictive discrepancy, aligning with Freud’s concept of wish fulfillment (Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2010). However, when the expression of a desire is inhibited due to social, moral, or internalized constraints, the mind must reconcile this predictive mismatch, leading to repression or displacement (Connolly, 2018).

A key insight from active inference is that repression is not merely a passive blockage of desire but an active inferential process that minimizes cognitive dissonance. The suppression of unwanted memories, as explored in research by Anderson et al. (2004), demonstrates that neural systems actively inhibit specific representations to align with an individual's generative model. This aligns with Freud’s concept of repression, where the ego exerts control over unconscious content to maintain psychological equilibrium. In this sense, desire is both a force pushing toward realization and a target of regulatory mechanisms that constrain it based on social and cognitive imperatives.

Desire also plays a crucial role in the structuring of selfhood, particularly through the interplay of the default mode network (DMN) and active inference processes. Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) have proposed that the DMN, a network associated with self-referential thinking and autobiographical memory, operates as a high-level generative model that constrains lower-level inferences. This network is implicated in maintaining ego functions, including the management of desire. The suppression or regulation of desire can be seen as an adaptive process that ensures the stability of self-representations. When these regulatory mechanisms fail, as in certain psychopathologies, intrusive desires and maladaptive behaviors can emerge, mirroring psychoanalytic concepts of neurosis and fixation (Friston et al., 2015).

Hierarchical active inference provides a structured way to understand the gradation of desires and their influence on behavior. Pezzulo, Rigoli, and Friston (2018) describe hierarchical active inference as a model in which high-level goals shape lower-level sensory and motor predictions. This framework suggests that desire operates at multiple levels of abstraction, from basic physiological needs to complex social and existential aspirations. The repression or transformation of desire, a core psychoanalytic process, can thus be seen as a hierarchical adjustment where high-level models constrain the expression of lower-level impulses. This perspective aligns with Lacanian theories of desire, which emphasize the symbolic structuring of desire through language and social norms.

Moreover, research on the inhibitory control of memory and emotion regulation supports the notion that desire is actively managed through neural mechanisms. Depue et al. (2015) highlight the role of the right prefrontal cortex in inhibitory regulation across cognitive, emotional, and motor domains. This suggests that the regulation of desire is not merely a learned social convention but an intrinsic feature of brain function, enabling individuals to navigate conflicting motivations. The ability to modulate desire is essential for adaptive behavior, as excessive inhibition can lead to psychological rigidity, while insufficient inhibition can result in impulsivity and distress.

The active inference framework also provides insights into the paradoxical nature of desire, where repression can sometimes intensify the very desires it seeks to suppress. When a desire is repressed, the generative model still anticipates its fulfillment, creating a persistent prediction error. This sustained mismatch can lead to increased salience of the repressed content, manifesting in symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, or somatic expressions (Gray, Bargh, & Morsella, 2013). This paradox is a central theme in psychoanalysis, where unfulfilled desires return in disguised forms, reinforcing the notion that repression is an active and dynamic process. The alignment between active inference and the concept of desire in psychoanalysis offers a bridge between computational neuroscience with depth psychology. Desire, from this perspective, is an inferential process that involves predicting and resolving discrepancies between internal states and external realities. Repression, inhibition, and transformation of desire are not merely defensive strategies but active processes that shape cognition and behavior through hierarchical inference mechanisms. This integration provides a novel framework for understanding the dynamic nature of desire, shedding light on its manifestations in both normal and pathological states. By combining psychoanalytic insights with contemporary models of brain function, this perspective enriches our understanding of human motivation and the intricate ways in which the mind negotiates its deepest longings and fears.
