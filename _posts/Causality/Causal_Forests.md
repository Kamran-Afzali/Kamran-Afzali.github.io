# Causal Inference in Practice: Causal Forests

## Introduction

Causal forests represent a breakthrough in heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, combining the flexibility of machine learning with the rigor of causal inference theory. Unlike traditional approaches that estimate average treatment effects or require pre-specified subgroups, causal forests automatically discover treatment effect heterogeneity across the covariate space while maintaining valid statistical inference. The method builds upon random forests but incorporates causal identification principles to ensure unbiased estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) at any point in the feature space.

This approach proves particularly valuable in personalized medicine, targeted policy interventions, and precision marketing, where treatment effects vary substantially across individuals or contexts. Traditional linear models assume constant treatment effects or require researchers to specify interaction terms a priori, limiting their ability to capture complex heterogeneity patterns. Causal forests overcome these limitations by nonparametrically estimating treatment effects as functions of observed covariates while providing honest confidence intervals that account for both sampling uncertainty and model selection.

The method's theoretical foundation rests on potential outcomes framework combined with honest estimation procedures that separate sample splitting for model selection from inference. This ensures that confidence intervals maintain nominal coverage rates despite the adaptive nature of tree-based methods. We examine causal forests' mathematical framework, implementation strategies, and practical application through a precision medicine example estimating heterogeneous effects of a new diabetes treatment using simulated clinical trial data in R.

Causal forests extend the random forest algorithm to causal inference settings where the goal shifts from prediction to treatment effect estimation. The key innovation lies in modifying the splitting criterion to maximize treatment effect heterogeneity rather than predictive accuracy. Consider a dataset with $n$ observations, where each unit $i$ has covariates $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$, treatment assignment $W_i \in \{0,1\}$, and observed outcome $Y_i$. Under the potential outcomes framework, each unit has two potential outcomes: $Y_i(0)$ under control and $Y_i(1)$ under treatment, with the individual treatment effect defined as $\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$.

The causal forest algorithm aims to estimate the conditional average treatment effect:

$$
\tau(x) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X_i = x]
$$

This represents the expected treatment effect for individuals with covariate values $x$. Unlike supervised learning where we observe outcomes directly, causal inference requires handling the fundamental problem that we never observe both potential outcomes for the same individual.

The method requires three key identifying assumptions. Unconfoundedness assumes that treatment assignment is as good as random conditional on observed covariates:

$$
\{Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\} \perp W_i | X_i
$$

This rules out unmeasured confounding that affects both treatment assignment and outcomes. Overlap requires that all individuals have positive probability of receiving either treatment:

$$
0 < \mathbb{P}(W_i = 1 | X_i = x) < 1 \text{ for all } x
$$

This ensures that we observe both treated and control units across the covariate space. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) requires that potential outcomes depend only on one's own treatment assignment, ruling out interference or spillover effects between units.

## Theoretical Framework

The causal forest algorithm modifies standard random forest procedures to focus on treatment effect heterogeneity. Each tree is grown using a random subsample of observations and covariates, but the splitting criterion differs fundamentally from prediction-focused algorithms. Rather than minimizing mean squared error or maximizing information gain, causal trees split nodes to maximize the difference in treatment effects between child nodes.

For a candidate split that partitions observations into sets $S_L$ and $S_R$, the splitting criterion evaluates:

$$
\Delta(S, S_L, S_R) = |S_L| \cdot (\hat{\tau}(S_L) - \hat{\tau}(S))^2 + |S_R| \cdot (\hat{\tau}(S_R) - \hat{\tau}(S))^2
$$

where $\hat{\tau}(S)$ represents the estimated treatment effect within set $S$, calculated as the difference in mean outcomes between treated and control units in that leaf. This criterion prefers splits that create child nodes with treatment effects that differ substantially from the parent node, thereby maximizing treatment effect heterogeneity.

The honesty principle ensures valid inference by requiring that the same observations not be used for both structure learning and treatment effect estimation. Each tree uses sample splitting where one subsample determines the tree structure (which variables to split on and where to split), while a separate subsample estimates treatment effects within each leaf. This separation prevents overfitting that would invalidate subsequent inference procedures.

For prediction at a new point $x$, causal forests aggregate across all trees, weighting observations based on how frequently they fall in the same leaf as $x$. Let $\alpha_i(x)$ denote the weight assigned to observation $i$ when predicting at point $x$, calculated as:

$$
\alpha_i(x) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \frac{\mathbf{1}(X_i \in L_b(x))}{|L_b(x)|}
$$

where $B$ is the number of trees, $L_b(x)$ is the leaf containing $x$ in tree $b$, and $|L_b(x)|$ is the number of observations in that leaf. The treatment effect estimate becomes:

$$
\hat{\tau}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i(x) \cdot W_i \cdot Y_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i(x) \cdot (1-W_i) \cdot Y_i
$$

This weighting scheme naturally adapts to local data density and treatment assignment patterns, providing more weight to observations that are similar to the prediction point.

### Inference and Confidence Intervals

Causal forests provide asymptotically normal treatment effect estimates under regularity conditions, enabling construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. The asymptotic variance of $\hat{\tau}(x)$ depends on both the treatment effect estimation variance and the uncertainty from adaptive tree selection:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\tau}(x)) = \sigma^2(x) \cdot V(x)
$$

where $\sigma^2(x)$ represents the conditional variance of outcomes at $x$, and $V(x)$ captures the effective sample size accounting for the forest weighting scheme. The variance estimate requires additional sample splitting to avoid bias from using the same data for both point estimation and variance estimation.

The method provides honest confidence intervals that maintain nominal coverage rates despite the adaptive nature of the algorithm. This represents a significant advance over naive approaches that ignore model selection uncertainty and produce overly optimistic confidence intervals.

### Comparison with Other Methods

Causal forests offer several advantages over traditional approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity. Unlike linear models with pre-specified interactions, causal forests automatically discover complex nonlinear patterns without requiring domain knowledge about relevant interactions. The method handles high-dimensional covariate spaces better than subgroup analysis, which suffers from multiple testing problems and lacks principled approaches for subgroup selection.

Compared to other machine learning approaches for causal inference, causal forests provide theoretical guarantees about consistency and asymptotic normality while maintaining computational efficiency. Unlike neural networks or support vector machines, the tree-based structure offers interpretability through variable importance measures and partial dependence plots. The method also handles mixed-type covariates naturally without requiring extensive preprocessing.

However, causal forests share limitations with other observational study methods, particularly sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. The method also requires substantial sample sizes for reliable estimation in high-dimensional settings and may struggle with very sparse regions of the covariate space where few observations are available for local treatment effect estimation.

## Healthcare Application: Personalized Diabetes Treatment

### Scenario

We examine heterogeneous effects of a new diabetes medication across patient subgroups. Clinical trials typically estimate average treatment effects, but precision medicine requires understanding how treatment benefits vary by patient characteristics. Our analysis estimates conditional average treatment effects as functions of age, BMI, baseline HbA1c levels, and comorbidity indicators, helping clinicians identify patients most likely to benefit from the new treatment.

The outcome is the change in HbA1c levels after 6 months of treatment, where larger reductions indicate better glycemic control. The treatment is binary assignment to the new medication versus standard care. Covariates include continuous measures (age, BMI, baseline HbA1c) and binary indicators (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease). The goal is to develop personalized treatment recommendations based on individual patient profiles.

### Assumptions and Validity

The unconfoundedness assumption requires that treatment assignment be as good as random conditional on observed patient characteristics. In randomized trials, this holds by design, but observational studies require careful consideration of potential confounders. Our simulation assumes random assignment within strata defined by baseline characteristics.

The overlap assumption requires that patients with similar characteristics have positive probability of receiving either treatment. This can be violated in practice if certain patient types are systematically excluded from new treatments due to safety concerns or contraindications. Checking overlap empirically involves examining propensity score distributions and identifying regions with insufficient variation in treatment assignment.

SUTVA assumes that one patient's treatment doesn't affect another's outcomes. This seems reasonable for individual medication decisions but could be violated in settings with peer effects or healthcare system spillovers. The assumption also requires that treatment be well-defined, ruling out different versions or dosing regimens that could affect outcomes differently.

### R Implementation

We simulate data for 2000 diabetes patients with realistic covariate distributions and heterogeneous treatment effects. The true treatment effect varies by age and baseline HbA1c, with younger patients and those with higher baseline values experiencing larger benefits. Our implementation uses the grf package, which provides optimized causal forest algorithms with honest inference procedures.

## Interpretation and Diagnostics

The causal forest successfully recovers heterogeneous treatment effects, with strong correlation between predicted and true effects indicating good performance. Variable importance rankings reveal which patient characteristics drive treatment effect heterogeneity, helping clinicians understand mechanisms underlying treatment response variation. Age and baseline HbA1c typically emerge as the most important predictors, consistent with clinical knowledge about diabetes treatment response patterns.

The heterogeneity test provides formal evidence for treatment effect variation across patients. Significant test results support using personalized treatment rules rather than treating all patients identically. This test compares the forest's predictions against a model assuming constant treatment effects, providing statistical evidence for the value of personalization.

Partial dependence plots illustrate how treatment effects vary along key dimensions. The age effect typically shows diminishing benefits for older patients, while the baseline HbA1c effect demonstrates larger benefits for patients with poorer initial glycemic control. These patterns align with clinical expectations and provide interpretable insights for treatment decisions.

Confidence intervals around individual predictions reflect both sampling uncertainty and the inherent difficulty of estimating effects in sparse regions of the covariate space. Wider intervals in regions with fewer observations suggest where additional data collection might improve precision. The honest inference procedure ensures these intervals maintain nominal coverage despite the adaptive nature of the algorithm.

## Extensions and Advanced Topics

### Double Machine Learning Integration

Causal forests can be combined with other machine learning methods through double machine learning frameworks. This approach uses separate algorithms to estimate the outcome regression and propensity score, then applies causal forests to estimate heterogeneous effects on residualized outcomes. This combination can improve performance when the outcome-covariate or treatment-covariate relationships are complex but the treatment effect heterogeneity follows simpler patterns.

```r
# Double machine learning with causal forests
# First stage: estimate nuisance parameters
if (!requireNamespace("randomForest", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)

# Estimate propensity scores
ps_forest <- randomForest(factor(W) ~ ., data = data.frame(X), ntree = 500)
e_hat <- predict(ps_forest, type = "prob")[, 2]

# Estimate outcome regression
outcome_forest <- randomForest(Y ~ ., data = data.frame(X, W), ntree = 500)
mu_hat <- predict(outcome_forest, data.frame(X, W = 1)) * e_hat + 
          predict(outcome_forest, data.frame(X, W = 0)) * (1 - e_hat)

# Residualize outcomes
Y_res <- Y - mu_hat
W_res <- W - e_hat

# Apply causal forest to residualized data
cf_dml <- causal_forest(X, Y_res, W_res, num.trees = 1000)
tau_dml <- predict(cf_dml)$predictions

cat("Double ML correlation with true effects:", round(cor(true_tau, tau_dml), 3), "\n")
```

### Multi-Arm Treatment Extensions

Causal forests extend naturally to settings with multiple treatment arms. The multi-arm causal forest algorithm estimates pairwise treatment contrasts, allowing researchers to identify optimal treatments for each individual from a set of alternatives. This proves particularly valuable in precision medicine where multiple treatment options exist.

### Policy Learning

Beyond estimating treatment effects, causal forests enable learning optimal treatment assignment rules. The approach combines treatment effect estimation with policy optimization, finding assignment rules that maximize expected outcomes subject to resource constraints or fairness considerations. This bridges descriptive causal inference with prescriptive policy analysis.

## Limitations and Considerations

Causal forests inherit limitations from both machine learning and causal inference domains. The method requires substantial sample sizes for reliable estimation, particularly in high-dimensional settings where the curse of dimensionality affects local estimation procedures. Rules of thumb suggest needing at least 20-50 observations per covariate dimension for stable results.

The honesty requirement, while theoretically necessary, reduces effective sample sizes by requiring sample splitting. This can limit performance in moderate-sized datasets where splitting reduces power substantially. Researchers face tradeoffs between honest inference and estimation precision that may favor alternative approaches in small samples.

Model interpretability, while better than black-box methods, remains limited compared to parametric approaches. Understanding why specific individuals receive particular treatment effect predictions requires additional analysis through partial dependence plots, SHAP values, or other post-hoc explanation methods.

The method assumes that treatment effect heterogeneity follows patterns that tree-based methods can capture effectively. Highly nonlinear relationships or interactions involving many variables simultaneously may challenge the algorithm's ability to discover relevant patterns. Alternative kernel-based or neural network approaches might perform better in such settings.

## Validation and Model Selection

### Cross-Validation Strategies

Standard cross-validation approaches require modification for causal inference settings to avoid bias from using the same observations for both treatment effect estimation and validation. Causal forest validation typically employs sample splitting where one subset trains the model and another evaluates performance on held-out treatment effects.

```r
# Cross-validation for causal forests
set.seed(456)
n_folds <- 5
fold_ids <- sample(rep(1:n_folds, length.out = n))
cv_results <- numeric(n_folds)

for (fold in 1:n_folds) {
  train_idx <- fold_ids != fold
  test_idx <- fold_ids == fold
  
  # Train on training set
  cf_fold <- causal_forest(X[train_idx, ], Y[train_idx], W[train_idx], 
                           num.trees = 1000)
  
  # Predict on test set
  tau_pred <- predict(cf_fold, X[test_idx, ])$predictions
  tau_true <- true_tau[test_idx]
  
  # Calculate mean squared error
  cv_results[fold] <- mean((tau_pred - tau_true)^2)
}

cat("Cross-validation MSE:", round(mean(cv_results), 4), 
    "±", round(sd(cv_results), 4), "\n")
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Key hyperparameters include the number of trees, minimum leaf size, and honesty fraction. While causal forests are relatively robust to these choices, systematic tuning can improve performance. The number of trees typically ranges from 1000-4000, with diminishing returns beyond this range. Minimum leaf size affects the bias-variance tradeoff, with smaller leaves reducing bias but increasing variance.

## Comparison with Alternative Methods

### Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)

BART provides another tree-based approach to treatment effect heterogeneity with different theoretical foundations. Unlike causal forests' frequentist framework, BART employs Bayesian inference with priors on tree structures. BART often performs well with smaller samples but lacks the theoretical guarantees of causal forests regarding inference validity.

### Meta-Learners

Meta-learning approaches like S-learner, T-learner, and X-learner provide alternative frameworks for treatment effect heterogeneity. These methods combine standard machine learning algorithms in different ways to estimate treatment effects. Causal forests generally outperform these approaches when sufficient data exists, but meta-learners may be preferable with limited samples or when using specialized algorithms for specific domains.

### Gaussian Process Approaches

Gaussian processes offer another nonparametric approach to treatment effect estimation with built-in uncertainty quantification. These methods excel at capturing smooth treatment effect surfaces but may struggle with high-dimensional covariates or discontinuous effects that tree-based methods handle naturally.

## Future Directions and Research

### Causal Forests with Confounding

Recent research extends causal forests to settings with unmeasured confounding using instrumental variables or negative control outcomes. These approaches maintain the flexibility of forest-based estimation while addressing identification challenges in observational studies.

### Online Learning and Adaptive Experiments

Causal forests can be integrated with adaptive experimental designs where treatment assignments update based on observed outcomes. This enables real-time personalization in clinical trials or digital experiments while maintaining statistical rigor.

### Fairness and Equity Considerations

Treatment effect heterogeneity raises important questions about fairness when some groups benefit more than others. Research explores how to incorporate equity constraints into causal forest algorithms to ensure that personalized treatments don't exacerbate existing disparities.

## Conclusion

Causal forests represent a significant methodological advance for understanding treatment effect heterogeneity in complex, high-dimensional settings. The method successfully combines machine learning flexibility with causal inference rigor, providing both point estimates and honest confidence intervals for conditional treatment effects. Our precision medicine application demonstrates practical implementation and highlights the method's ability to discover clinically meaningful patterns of treatment response variation.

The approach excels when sufficient data exists and treatment effects vary in ways that tree-based methods can capture. Variable importance measures and partial dependence plots provide interpretable insights into heterogeneity patterns, supporting clinical decision-making and policy formulation. The theoretical guarantees regarding asymptotic normality and confidence interval coverage represent important advances over ad-hoc machine learning approaches to causal inference.

However, successful implementation requires careful attention to sample size requirements, honest estimation procedures, and validation strategies. The method works best as part of a comprehensive analytical approach that includes domain expertise, assumption checking, and sensitivity analysis. Future research continues to extend the framework to handle unmeasured confounding, multiple outcomes, and fairness constraints, expanding its applicability across diverse domains.

When applied appropriately, causal forests provide powerful tools for precision medicine, targeted policy interventions, and any setting where treatment effects vary across individuals. The method's combination of statistical rigor and practical flexibility makes it an essential addition to the causal inference toolkit for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and exploit treatment effect heterogeneity.
