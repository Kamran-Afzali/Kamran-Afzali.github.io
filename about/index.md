<p>
I'm a quantitative psychologist and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Psychology from Toulouse University, where I specialized in quantitative methods and studied how to predict risk behaviors using computational approaches. I currently work as a data specialist and research adviser, and also take on independent data science projects.
My work focuses on building computational tools that help understand and assess human behavior, particularly in healthcare, mental health, and clinical settings. I design and evaluate systems for handling clinical data, apply Bayesian modeling and machine learning methods, and create interactive dashboards for research. I also develop systems to anonymize sensitive text data while preserving its research value.
I'm particularly interested in causal inference, computational psychiatry, and agent-based modeling. Most of my projects involve combining solid statistical methods with practical solutions for digital health and behavioral science applications.
