<p>
I'm a quantitative psychologist and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Psychology from Toulouse University/France, where I specialized in quantitative methods and studied prediction modelling of risk behaviors with computational approaches. I currently work as a data scientist and research adviser, and also take on independent data science projects. My work focuses on building computational tools that help understand and assess human behavior, particularly in healthcare and clinical settings. I design and evaluate systems for handling clinical data, apply Bayesian modeling and machine learning methods, and create interactive dashboards for research. My projects turn around combining statistical methods with practical solutions for digital health and behavioral science applications. Take a look at my blog posts, my publications and dont hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
